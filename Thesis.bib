{Problem}},
  shorttitle = {Lawful {Hacking}},
  url = {https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD1045945},
  abstract = {This thesis examines the ongoing debate between law enforcement and the intelligence
communities on one side, and the technology industry and privacy rights groups on the other, over
the going dark problem. Going dark is a phenomenon created by ubiquitous use of end-to-end
encryption over communication devices and Internet platforms, rendering those communications
warrant-proof. End-to-end encryption means that only the sender and receiver of the message can
read it, and no one in between. Even with a properly executed warrant or subpoena, law enforcement
and intelligence agencies are unable to access the data they need because that data was encrypted.
This thesis explores the historical, political and legislative developments that contributed to the
rise of encryption in recent years, as well as constitutional doctrines that may be relevant to the
public debate over possible policy solutions. Through the policy options analysis method, this
thesis identifies lawful hacking as a middle-ground solution that policymakers should adopt in the
short term. It also recommends that the U.S. government initiate a public education campaign to
gain public support for some form of regulation concerning encryption in the future. The
fundamental issue here is not only about the tension between privacy and security. The issue is
also about who should make decisions with broad implications for the collective security: elected
officials or the technology industry.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the current debate over encryption policy. Through careful
evaluation of possible solutions to ‘going dark’ as well has weighting the costsand benefits of
each solution, we found exceptional access to information more harmful than helpful. Today, there
seems to be no singular leading answer to the going dark problem. Exceptional access to data and
communications is a simple solution for a simple problem, however going dark is very complex, and
requires a multifaceted and refined solutions. Widespread encryption forces those
listening—whether it is the NSA, FBI, foreign governments, criminals or terrorist—to be much
more targeted. As for the going dark metaphor, it seems as though we are not entirely “going
dark”, and yet we are not completely bright either. There are dark and bright spots coming and
going across the technological landscape battling in a perpetual technological arms race. The
findings of this paper, ultimately determine there to be no policy that doesn’t come without some
cost. That said, there are a number of ways in which law enforcement can track criminals and
terrorist without weakening encryption, which we determine to be the best direction in any win lose
situation. Nevertheless, as technology continues to evolve and encryption capabilities continue to
become a part of everyday life for Americans this debate will only grow larger, and we, as a
society, must determine how tomake the best of it.},

  abstract = {Various authors on cybersecurity have compared cyberspace to the high seas and
suggested that states should contract privateers, in the form of private corporations or
individuals, in order to bolster their defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace. This
conceptual paper explores the high seas-cyberspace analogy and evaluates the extent to which it can
strategically inform the battle against cybercrime. It is argued that the historical battle against
piracy, characterized by its emphasis on legal frameworks, the removal of market support
structures, and states’ use of privateers, offers limited lessons with regard to cybercrime. The
analogy suggests that strategies against cybercrime should stress the usefulness of existing legal
structures and earmark additional resources for them, while also prioritizing the establishing of
specialized cybercrime courts and the hiring of former cybercriminals. Moreover, the comparison
between piracy and cybercrime suggests that cybercrime should be treated as a socio-economic
problem, while the historical use of privateers can be reimagined as cyber-privateering to
potentially construct a new model of cyberdeterrence.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes two cryptography discourses dealing with the question of
whether governments should be able to monitor secure and encrypted communication, for example via
security vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems. The Clipper chip debate of 1993 and the FBI vs.
Apple case of 2016 are analyzed to infer whether these discourses show similarities in their
arguments and to draw lessons from them. The study is based on the securitization framework and
analyzes the social construction of security threats in political discourses. The findings are that
the arguments made by the proponents of exceptional access show major continuities between the two
cases. In contrast, the arguments of the critics are more diverse. The critical arguments for
stronger encryption remain highly relevant, especially in the context of the Snowden revelations.
The article concludes that we need to adopt a more general cyber security perspective, considering
the threat of cyber crime and state hacking, when debating whether the government should be able to
weaken encryption.},

  abstract = {From the thesis abstract: This thesis explores the issue law enforcement has been
confronting since the Edward Snowden leaks prompted technology companies to design their
communication devices with enhanced encryption. As a result of these modifications, many
investigations have been stymied because providers claim that they can no longer furnish law
enforcement with device and communication content, even when so ordered by the court. Device
designers and communication providers claim that enhanced encryption is intended to protect
individual privacy and corporate intellectual property. However, these changes have resulted in
providing criminals and terrorists alike with avenues to communicate anonymously and out of law
enforcement's reach. A significant issue is that legislation has not kept pace with emerging
communication platforms. The Policy Analysis method was employed to explore potential solutions to
this issue, culminating with the conclusion that the problem requires a two-pronged approach to
address both data in motion, and data at rest. Data in motion refers to communications in real
time, and it should be addressed by installing spyware to capture the content. Data at rest refers
to stored content, and it should be addressed by the use of split-key encryption. Both methods
would require amending current statutes or drafting entirely new legislation to cover existing and
future communication platforms.},

  abstract = {The connectivity of information systems and networks, and the increasing usage of the
Internet have opened individuals and governments to new types of vulnerabilities necessitating the
rapid development of cybersecurity policy. Defining cybersecurity as the protection of information
systems and networks from misuse, intentional or unintentional harm, or the degradation,
destruction, or denial of services provided through the internet and related to the “Internet of
Things,” this report seeks to address the question of what the US’s cybersecurity policy should
be moving forward. The report seeks to answer this question by addressing the major thematic issues
in US domestic and international cybersecurity policy, and focusing in on five issues that crosscut
domestic and international cybersecurity policy: • There is a lack of trust between citizens,
industry, and government • Cybersecurity legislation is overly broad and ambiguous • There is
lack of cooperation between stakeholders • Policy implementation is weak • Discord amongst
states internationally is hindering the development international cybersecurity norms, despite a
demonstrated desire for such norms This report finds that the United States lacks a robust,
unanimous, and coordinated framework for ensuring the safety of private, governmental, and business
networks. Enhancing and building strong partnerships between industry and government should be a
strategic imperative for all stakeholders. Taking into account the central issues we have
identified, in order for the US to develop robust cybersecurity policy, we recommend the following:
• Standardization o Establish common cyber threat assessment protocols and strong procedural and
legal frameworks utilizing precise language. o Narrow existing, broad policy to foster trust and
engagement between industry, states, and civil groups. • Collaboration o Work closely with
existing international organizations to harmonize and balance international cybersecurity norms. o
Creation of proactive, future oriented legislation by building publicprivate partnerships across
multiple sectors. o Streamline the current governmental accreditation processes for innovative
industry leaders. In this report we will outline existing US cybersecurity policy both domestically
and internationally, identify major stakeholders on all sides of the debate and engage with each
position as it relates to the others, determine gaps in the existing policy, and propose how the US
can fill those gaps to further develop comprehensive and efficient cybersecurity policy. Drawing on
the history of domestic legislation of cyber policy, international agreements, the perspective of
key industry leaders, and the arguments of civil society groups, this report provides a holistic
picture of the field in its present state and what must be improved upon.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the encryption policies of Israel and China in an effort to
determine whether their respective approaches effectively and reasonably address the issue of law
enforcement access to encrypted devices in the United States. The proliferation of encrypted
devices poses a growing challenge to law enforcement agencies in their efforts to gather evidence.
Meanwhile, an ongoing debate, decades in the making, persists between those arguing for and against
easing the means by which the government accesses these encrypted devices. Using qualitative
analysis, the thesis assesses the encryption policies of Israel and China in terms of legality,
cost, political acceptance, and potential for success in their application within the United
States. Based on this analysis, this thesis recommends policymakers give consideration to a
solution that resembles Israel’s approach. The characteristics of this model include creating,
under existing laws, a centralized forensic laboratory supported by a network of examiners located
across the country working to gain access to encrypted devices through vulnerabilities. These
efforts would be bolstered by relationships with the private sector and academia. Tailoring the
U.S. device encryption approach to be more consistent in structure with that of Israel has the
potential to bring the United States closer to a viable domestic solution.},

  abstract = {We study secure and undetectable communication in a world where governments can read
all encrypted communications of citizens. We consider a world where the only permitted
communication method is via a government-mandated encryption scheme, using government-mandated
keys. Citizens caught trying to communicate otherwise (e.g., by encrypting strings which do not
appear to be natural language plaintexts) will be arrested. The one guarantee we suppose is that
the government-mandated encryption scheme is semantically secure against outsiders: a perhaps
advantageous feature to secure communication against foreign entities. But what good is semantic
security against an adversary that has the power to decrypt? Even in this pessimistic scenario, we
show citizens can communicate securely and undetectably. Informally, there is a protocol between
Alice and Bob where they exchange ciphertexts that look innocuous even to someone who knows the
secret keys and thus sees the corresponding plaintexts. And yet, in the end, Alice will have
transmitted her secret message to Bob. Our security definition requires indistinguishability
between unmodified use of the mandated encryption scheme, and conversations using the mandated
encryption scheme in a modified way for subliminal communication. Our topics may be thought to fall
broadly within the realm of steganography: the science of hiding secret communication in
innocent-looking messages, or cover objects. However, we deal with the non-standard setting of
adversarial cover object distributions (i.e., a stronger-than-usual adversary). We leverage that
our cover objects are ciphertexts of a secure encryption scheme to bypass impossibility results
which we show for broader classes of steganographic schemes. We give several constructions of
subliminal communication schemes based on any key exchange protocol with random messages (e.g.,
Diffie-Hellman).},

  shorttitle = {{TPM}-{FAIL}},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05673},
  abstract = {Trusted Platform Module (TPM) serves as a hardware-based root of trust that protects
cryptographic keys from privileged system and physical adversaries. In this work, we perform a
black-box timing analysis of TPM 2.0 devices deployed on commodity computers. Our analysis reveals
that some of these devices feature secret-dependent execution times during signature generation
based on elliptic curves. In particular, we discovered timing leakage on an Intel firmware-based
TPM as well as a hardware TPM. We show how this information allows an attacker to apply lattice
techniques to recover 256-bit private keys for ECDSA and ECSchnorr signatures. On Intel fTPM, our
key recovery succeeds after about 1,300 observations and in less than two minutes. Similarly, we
extract the private ECDSA key from a hardware TPM manufactured by STMicroelectronics, which is
certified at Common Criteria (CC) EAL 4+, after fewer than 40,000 observations. We further
highlight the impact of these vulnerabilities by demonstrating a remote attack against a StrongSwan
IPsec VPN that uses a TPM to generate the digital signatures for authentication. In this attack,
the remote client recovers the server's private authentication key by timing only 45,000
authentication handshakes via a network connection. The vulnerabilities we have uncovered emphasize
the difficulty of correctly implementing known constant-time techniques, and show the importance of
evolutionary testing and transparent evaluation of cryptographic implementations. Even certified
devices that claim resistance against attacks require additional scrutiny by the community and
industry, as we learn more about these attacks.},
