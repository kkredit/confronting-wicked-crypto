- Clearly separate policy and mechanism
- Do not outright criminalize any form of encryption

### Policy Goals

- Support all forms of online security
- Preclude mass surveillance
- Preclude human rights abuse
- Include transparency (matyas_incommensurability_2018, savage_lawful_2018)
- Do not establish new trust relationships

## Technical

- Employ defense in depth
