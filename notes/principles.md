# EA Principles

## Notes from Reading

### varia_2018

- Data location (1)(3)
- Physical vs remote access (1)(3)
- Scope (encryption by default vs all encryption everywhere) (2)
- Past vs future (need to be able to go back?) (1)(2)
- Accessibility to agents (2)
- Compliance (4)
- Delay (2)

### group_2019

- Law enforcement utility (2)
- Equity (3)
- Specificity (3)
- Focus (3)
- Authorization  (3)(4)
- Limitation (3)
- Auditability (to the user) (4)
- Transparency, evaluation, and oversight (to the public) (4)

### committee_decrypting_2018

- (Law enforcement utility) (2)
- Cybersecurity (device, broadly) (1)
- Privacy and civil liberties (3)
- Commerce and innovation (5)
- Costs and who bears them (5)
- Consistency with existing law and policy goals (3)(4)
- International impact (3)(5)
- (Transparency, evaluation, and oversight) (4)

### Condensed for map

Goals of a solution

1. Security impact (device, generally)
2. Law enforcement utility (accuracy, speed, cost)
3. Mitigation of mass surveillance, abuse
4. Transparency (to user, public)
5. Economic impacts (competitiveness, who bears cost)

## Policy Moving Forward

### Legal Framework

- Differentiate between principles and rules (matyas_incommensurability_2018)
- Clearly separate policy and mechanism
- Do not outright criminalize any form of encryption

### Policy Goals

- Support all forms of online security
- Preclude mass surveillance
- Preclude human rights abuse
- Include transparency (matyas_incommensurability_2018, savage_lawful_2018)
- Do not establish new trust relationships

## Technical

- Employ defense in depth
- Do not trust HW/SW of a confiscated device; extract data from storage and analyze on separate device (tromer_2018)
- Make decryption attempts transparent (stajano_making_2017)
