# Objections

Research in this topic elicits objections on many levels. This document lists, classifies, and
responds to them in a short and informal manner.

## Unsorted Complete List of Objections

1. Lawful access is a slippery slope
2. Access tools are powerful in the wrong hands
3. Encryption is the basis for all trust on the internet
4. Criminals, being criminals, will flout the law and use encryption anyway
5. Usage scope will creep; it will be abused and used for unintended purposes
6. Industry doesn't want this for ideological reasons
7. Industry doesn't want this for competitiveness reasons
8. US legislature is incompetent with tech (see CFAA, telecoms regulation) so cannot be trusted
   with encryption regulation
9. [Outdated bad proposal] is hopelessly inadequate
10. Government should not have absolute access to data
11. When a control is easily circumventable, the only ones hurt are the ignorant
12. There is no overlap between crimes severe enough to warrant access and suspects using poor
    enough op-sec for this to help
13. Government is already too powerful
14. Repressive governments will use this against reformers and activists
15. Making technological progress illegal is backward
16. [Some respected security authority] says it's a bad idea
17. The people I often agree with say it's a bad idea
18. Bad actors will exploit EA mechanisms for their own gain
19. International cooperation and jurisdictional issues are a big struggle
20. LEAs already have plenty of paths to plaintext and criminal evidence

## Reflection

Without responding to each argument in turn, most objections fall into one of four categories:

- Ideology
  - Absolute right to privacy (10, 13)
  - Outlawing technological progress is backwards (15)
- Power
  - Scope will creep (1, 5)
  - Government already has enough, or too much, power (6, 10, 13)
  - Tools could end up in the wrong hands (2)
  - The wrong people will be hurt (4, 11, 14)
- Implementation
  - Encryption is too foundational for integrity and confidentiality to compromise (3)
  - US legislature is incompetent with tech policy (8)
  - Current proposals are inadequately secure (9)
  - Current proposals will hurt US international competitiveness (7)
  - Current proposals will not address the problems we're hoping to fix (4, 12)
- Fallacy
  - Straw man attacks (9)
  - Appeal to authority (16)
  - Bandwagon (17)
  - Nirvana fallacy (demanding perfection)

Objections based on concerns over the balance of power created by an extraordinary access mechanism
are extremely important. Objections based on implementation issues are also important. Objections
based on fallacious arguments are unhelpful at best.

I'm interested in finding a set of properties that would satisfy most peoples' power objections. It
is true that we have neither enough agreement on our goals nor the technology at this time to
produce an acceptable solution. But those are reasons for more research in the area. Implementation
objections are also reasons for more research.

It is true that US legislature is incompetent on technical issues (e.g. CFAA, telecoms regulation).
But they do still make the rules. If society decides that access should be allowed under some
circumstances and the technical community doesn't produce better proposals than we currently have,
congress will not hesitate to pass a bad law. One can try to convince society that access indeed
should never be allowed, but there's good reason for the debate, and to put all our eggs in that
basket is a risk in itself.

<!-- When approaching technical problems with societal implications, it is helpful to separate the
properties of a desired solution and the technical means used to achieve those properties.
Determining the properties of the solution is the responsibility of society. Creating and studying
the technology available to achieve those properties is the responsibility of the technical
community. -->

<!-- Technologies have a built-in morality. A generally compromised encryption scheme says that will
of the government is more important than the individual's privacy. A perfectly unaccessible
encryption says the individual's privacy is more important than any amount of societal will. A
principled extraordinary access scheme says that the individual's and society's wills are held in
balance. -->
