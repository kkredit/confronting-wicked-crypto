# What is the problem

I began this by saying "EA is a wicked problem"--but EA isn't a problem, it's a proposed solution. The wicked problem is
how to regulate encryption technology in the face of public, LE, and technical community interests in data security,
public security, privacy, and the ability to investigate and convict wrongdoing.

So when organizing the arguments into a map, it shouldn't be centered on EA itself. It should

1. Elaborate the competing problems
2. Contextualize EA as a thread of this larger picture; a relatively "tame" solution to this wicked problem
3. Other solutions:
   - kerr_encryption_2017
   - carter_2018

What _do_ real solutions to wicked problems look like? They are dynamic and iterative. They are not narrow. They require
buy-in from stakeholders. (commission_tackling_2018)

If EA is going to be part of the solution, it needs to be flexible, to be iterable, to have buy-in, to work alongside
other solutions. From a technical perspective, requirements to be flexible and iterable will be difficult to implement.
