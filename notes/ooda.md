# On OODA for Wicked Problems

## OODA in Security

OODA is currently used in incident response. (schneier_future_2014)

Note on the limits of intuition: Skill levels of chess players: the difference between children and adults is less than
masters and grandmasters. So, common sense and intuition == adults; random == children; so intuition doesn't work beyond
a certain point.

## Wicked Problem properties and OODA

Risk management options: avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept

1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem; identifying the problem is tantamount to solving it
   - Problem: Collecting the necessary information (observation) depends on one's perception of a solution;
     _observation depends on orientation_; you cannot go observe->orient because without orientation, you don't know
     what to observe!
   - **Mitigate** Recursively observe and orient with a diverse set of participants. Emphasis on Orienting reflecting
     back on Observing! Most of the time is spent there.
2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule
   - Problem: when is it time for a decision? When is the process complete?
   - Decision time: TODO: this is hard; when does the cost of doing nothing become too high?
   - Complete: **Accept** never; the loop is indefinite. The level of activity may be small during periods of little change
3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad, where goodness is judged by conflicting value
   systems
   - Problem: How do we know when a proposed step is good enough for enough people?
   - TODO: see (2); when do you accept a solution
4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem
   - Problem: even if a step is considered good enough at the time, the lasting effects of a step cannot be predicted
     ahead of time. Our predictions fail.
   - **Accept** There is nothing to be done about this. Predicting the future is impossible, so we can only do our best.
     Avoiding is impossible, as inaction has its own consequences.
5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by
   trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly
   - Problem: the only testbed is the real world. All steps are impactful.
   - **Mitigate** Limit the statutory authority of the OODAing body so that it takes relatively conservative steps
   - Potentially encourage experimentation? In different states, for example. This has its own difficulties.
   - See wicked_crypto, I think he talked about this
6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is
   there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan
   - Problem: the problem space is huge, the solution space essentially infinite. Feeds (2).
   - **Accept** This requires creativity and ideation on behalf of the OODAing body
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique
   - Problem: a solution to one problem does not translate to others.
   - **Accept** The OODAing body is authorized to address this question only (though it may traverse levels of
     cause-and-effect within reason; perhaps the more steps it moves away from its original commission, the less
     authority it has)
8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem
   - Problem: At what level should one address the problem? Too high makes is impossible, too low only addresses
     symptoms
   - **Mitigate** See (7); allow body can traverse cause-and-effect within reasonable limits
9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of
   explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution
   - Problem: how do we evaluate the body's decisions and effectiveness? Is this just a jobs creation bill: 20 more
     do-nothings in DC?
   - **Mitigate** See (1); evaluate steps using criteria appropriate to each step's underlying problem+solution
     structure. The diverse set of participants means each perspective will be heard. Evaluate the body as a whole using
     the commissioning body's perceptions of the original issue.
10. The planner has no right to be wrong
    - Problem: Each step is important, placing personal and professional stress on the body members
    - **Mitigate** The body is constrained (5) so that they can not be crushingly wrong; members are judged with
      understanding of the difficulty of the task and not held personally responsible for the outcome

## Ten Properties -> 4 Problems

1. (1) Problem definition depends on solutions; there is no linear observe->orient
   - 1 **Mitigate** Observe->Orient becomes Observe<=>Orient
2. (2,3,4,6,8,9) Steps cannot be effectively evaluated for good-ness (among differing values 3/8/9, ahead of time 4,
   whether the research was sufficient 2/6)
   - 3,6,8,9 **Mitigate** Make OODAing body diverse in education, experience, and values
   - 2,6 **Mitigate** Make emphasize the "loop" portion of the OODA loop; it is repeated out of respect for the
     viciousness of the problem
   - 9 **Mitigate** Judge the effectiveness of the body (oversight) based on metrics appropriate each step as well as
     perceptions about the admittedly vague original commission; judgements should avoid hardline ideology
   - 4 **Accept** Steps must be taken with incomplete knowledge
3. (5,10) Each step has permanent impacts
   - Like throwing a bird instead of a stone (commission_tackling_2018)
   - **Mitigate** Limit the authority of the OODAing body within certain bounds to limit the magnitude of unintended
     effects
   - **Mitigate** Encourage experimentation when possible
   - **Accept** Decisions will have unintended negative consequences
4. (7) Solutions are not reusable
   - **Accept**
