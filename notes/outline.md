1. Motivation
2. Background
3. Wicked problems
   1. Characteristics
   2. Why encryption+EA is a wicked problem
   3. Traditional policy making approaches
<!-- % 1. Classical analytic method; each step has its own approaches, e.g. cost-benefit analysis (loosely based on
%  natural sciences)
%   (missing: Observe)
%   a. Define the problem (Orient)
%   b. Identify a goal (Orient)
%   c. Generate a range of alternatives for achieving that goal (Orient)
%   d. Select the alternative that seems most promising (Decide)
%   e. Implement the selected alternative (Act)
%   (missing: loop) -->
   4. Failure of traditional methods
   5. Proposal: thoughtful iteration
      1. Benefits
      2. Model: OODA loop
         1. Observe: (remainder of this chapter + next)
            1. survey legal environment (chap 2, bg)
            2. analyze use of cryptosystems (chap 2)
            3. listen to arguments (chap 3, args)
            4. review (and do) security research (chap 3/chap 4, tm)
         2. Orient: (chap 5, analysis)
            1. analyze arguments
            2. reflect on past experience
            3. synthesize research
         3. Decide:
            1. (me: provide conclusion and recommendations)
            2. Tech: choose what threats to consider and how to handle risk
            3. Gov: create a legal or regulatory framework to handle this issue, fund research
         4. Act:
            1. (me: publish this research)
            2. Tech: implement mitigations
            3. Gov: pass and follow through on legislation, regulation, and funding
   6. More observation: arguments and accompanying facts and statistics
4. Threat modeling (observation and enhancement of state of the art)
   1. Prominent proposals
   2. DFDs
      1. Device crypto
      2. E2E crypto
   3. Application of proposals to DFDs
   4. Threats
5. Analysis (Orientation)
   1. Reasonability of arguments
   2. Summary of state of the art
   3. Desirable outcomes
   4. Broad wholistic approaches we can take
6. Conclusions
   1. Choose best wholistic approach
   2. Reiterate OODA strategy
