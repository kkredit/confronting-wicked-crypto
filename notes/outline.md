1. Introduction
   1. What is the issue
   2. Why is it important
2. Background
   1. Results of literature review; current state of the art
   2. Technical state
      1. Preview some current proposals
   3. Legal and regulatory state
   4. Preview the path forward
      1. No regulatory force till we're technically ready
      2. Pursue more research (congress: fund it!)
3. Threat model
   1. Define context, constraints, and givens
   2. Develop DFD-like graphical model; high level
   3. Enumerate STRIDE-per-element-like threats (how detailed to go?)
4. Analysis or current proposals over threat model
   1. Reproduce diagram with certain parts highlighted or removed to visually demonstrate the
        proposal
   2. Discuss each model's means of addressing threats
   3. Infer each model's value system
   4. Discuss strengths and weaknesses
5. Proposal of "protocol suite" (?)
   1. Define horizontal boundaries
      1. Interfaces
      2. Responsibility of each
   2. Define vertical layers of abstraction
      1. Responsibility of each
6. Explore path forward
7. Conclusion
