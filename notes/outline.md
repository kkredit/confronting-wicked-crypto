1. Motivation
2. Background
3. Wicked problems
   1. Characteristics
      1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem
      2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule
      3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad
      4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a  solution to a  wicked problem
      5. Every solution to a  wicked problem is a  "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by
         trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly
      6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is
         there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan
      7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique
      8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem
      9. The  existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of
         explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution
      10. The planner has no right to be wrong
   2. Why encryption+EA is a wicked problem
   3. Traditional policy making approaches
<!-- % 1. Classical analytic method; each step has its own approaches, e.g. cost-benefit analysis (loosely based on
%  natural sciences)
%   (missing: Observe)
%   a. Define the problem (Orient)
%   b. Identify a goal (Orient)
%   c. Generate a range of alternatives for achieving that goal (Orient)
%   d. Select the alternative that seems most promising (Decide)
%   e. Implement the selected alternative (Act)
%   (missing: loop) -->
   4. Failure of traditional methods
   5. Proposal: thoughtful iteration
      1. Benefits
      2. Model: OODA loop
         1. Observe: (remainder of this chapter + next)
            1. survey legal environment (chap 2, bg)
            2. analyze use of cryptosystems (chap 2)
            3. listen to arguments (chap 3, args)
            4. review (and do) security research (chap 3/chap 4, tm)
         2. Orient: (chap 5, analysis)
            1. analyze arguments
            2. reflect on past experience
            3. synthesize research
         3. Decide:
            1. (me: provide conclusion and recommendations)
            2. Tech: choose what threats to consider and how to handle risk
            3. Gov: create a legal or regulatory framework to handle this issue, fund research
         4. Act:
            1. (me: publish this research)
            2. Tech: implement mitigations
            3. Gov: pass and follow through on legislation, regulation, and funding
   6. More observation: arguments and accompanying facts and statistics
4. Threat modeling (observation and enhancement of state of the art)
   1. Who are the threat actors (include govt, alex and becca)
   2. Prominent proposals
   3. DFDs
      1. Device crypto
      2. E2E crypto
   4. Application of proposals to DFDs
   5. Threats, risks
5. Analysis (Orientation)
   1. Reasonability of arguments
   2. Summary of state of the art
   3. Desirable outcomes
   4. Broad strategies we can take
6. Conclusions
   1. Choose best strategy
   2. Reiterate OODA approach
