## Terms

* Backdoor: generally, a non-standard route to plaintext; in practice, this term is used differently by different
  parties, and is too stigmatized to convey meaning.
* Common Carrier: a party that transports goods and is not responsible for their contents or loss, granted they meet
  certain requirements. Applicability to electronic telecommunications is formalized for ISPs, but not for online
  platforms.
* The Four Horsemen (of the Infocalypse): four reasons that governments and law enforcement agencies use, ostensibly as
  scare tactics, to drum up support for EA. The four horsemen are:
  * Terrorists
  * Pedophiles (child pornographers)
  * Drug dealers
  * Money launderers (traditional by Tim May; or kidnappers, Schneier)
