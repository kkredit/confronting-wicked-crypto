# Crypto Wars Timeline

## From thompson_2015

- 0 B.C.: Crypto used by militaries, govts for a long time.
- 1976: Entered the public sphere with public key crypto; in a few years govts were already seeing it as a problem
- 1993: Clinton white house introduces Clipper Chip, "providing the public with strong cryptographic tools without
    sacrificing the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access unencrypted versions of those
    communications". The debate begins.
- 1994: Matt Blaze discovers a flaw in the chip design, and the chip proposal is dead. (blaze_protocol_1994)
- 1990s: The idea for EA lives on; key escrow systems are the dominant approach.
- 1996: Crypto tools no longer considered munitions; may be exported. The US didn't want foreign entities to have
    strong encryption, but it was increasingly available anyway, and locking the US out of foreign markets. There
    remained limits on key length.
- 1997: "There was an overwhelming amount of evidence against moving ahead with any key escrow schemes".
- 1999: All limits on key length are removed.

## From kehl_right_2015

- 1993: Clinton white house introduces Clipper Chip
- 1994: Industry reacts negatively to the proposal
- 1994: Matt Blaze discovers a flaw in the chip design
- 1996: Crypto tools no longer considered munitions; may be exported. Some more details on "export grade" encryption.
- 1996: Rep. Bob Goodlatte introduces SAFE Act "'to affirm the rights of United States persons to use and sell
    encryption and to relax export controls on encryption.' It included provisions that would have barred the government
    from creating a mandatory key escrow system and would also have removed export restrictions on most generally
    available software and hardware containing encryption."
- 1996-1999: SAFE Act is prop0sed several times, has hearings, and gains support.
- 1999: Clinton administration executively implements almost all of SAFE Act proposals, and the bill is dropped (!).

## From Me

- What is triggering this round?
  - 2013: Snowden revelations
  - mid-2010s: Default device encryption by smartphone providers
  - late-2010s: Default E2E by messaging services

Perhaps the narrative is: Govt gives up on SE in the late 90s because it accepted the benefits and _could get the data
anyway_. That they were collecting the data anyway was revealed in 2013. In response, companies significantly improved
device and message security. Now, the govt _actually_ is having difficulty accessing data. CWII.
