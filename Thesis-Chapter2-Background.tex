introduces threat modeling with data flow diagrams.

\section{A Brief History of Encryption}
\label{sec-history}

Private use of encryption has a contentious history. [Some highlights.]

Electronic encryption must be understood as a technological development embedded in the longer history of privacy and
human rights. [This is where I'd like to understand more of the legal side. With a historical perspective.]

Privacy is not encryption's only purpose, however. Encryption is the technical foundation for many forms of computer and
network security. [Properties: confidentiality, authentication, integrity, non-repudiation; primitives: hashed
passwords, digital signatures, ...; technologies: PKI, TLS, SSO/Kerberos, VPNs, disk encryption, blockchains, ...]

Electronic encryption's dual role as enabler of perfect privacy and cornerstone of computer security may be the central
conflict in the exceptional access debate. Those who focus on its role in privacy object to its absolute power. Those
who focus on its role in security rely on its absolute power.

% Encryption requires absolute cryptographic fidelity in order to provide security.

\subsubsection*{Historical Approaches}

Historical approaches and proposals out of the first crypto war that saw various amounts of support.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clipper chip
    \item Government key escrow
    \item Oblivious key escrow \cite{goos_oblivious_1996}
    \item Partial key escrow (see \cite{denning_taxonomy_1996})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Modern Proposals}

Recent proposals out of the second crypto war that have various levels of support.

\begin{itemize}
    \item CLEAR \cite{ozzie_2018}
    \item Device escrow with HW \cite{savage_lawful_2018}
    \item Computational, blockchain approaches \cite{phan_key_2017}
    \item Lawful hacking \cite{nguyen_lawful_2017} \cite{soesanto_2018}
    \item Forced password disclosure \cite{bittenbender_2019}, see \cite{kerr_encryption_2017}
\end{itemize}
