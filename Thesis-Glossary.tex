\newterm{wicked-prob}{wicked problem}{
    A problem lacking clear formulations, causes, resolutions, or metrics. Consistenly difficult to solve, and often
    social or political in nature
}

\newterm{the-cw1}{the first crypto war}{
    The flurry of evolution and conflict in encryption policy during the 1990s, characterized by episodes around export
    controls, \ac{PGP}, the \ac{clipperchip}, and early key escrow proposals
}
\newterm{the-cw2}{the second crypto war}{
    The flurry of conflict in encryption policy during the late 2010s to present, characterized by angst from the
    Snowden revelations, the proliferation of strong encryption, and the Apple vs. FBI case
}

\newterm{clipperchip}{Clipper Chip}{
    A 1993 initiative by the Clinton administration to provide ``the public with strong cryptographic tools without
    sacrificing the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access unencrypted versions of those
    communications'' via hardware additions to consumer electronics. The proposal faced opposition, and died in 1994
    when security researcher Matt Blaze discovered flaws that allowed users to subvert the Clipper Chip mechanisms
}

    the private key
}
\newterm{sym-crypto}{symmetric cryptography}{
    A cipher scheme where encryption and decryption are performed with the same key
}

\newterm{forward-secrecy}{forward secrecy}{
    A property of \ac{DIM} encryption protocols that ensures that a leaked private key or session key does not
    compromise any other private key or session key
}
\newterm{replay-protection}{replay protection}{
    A property of \ac{DIM} encryption protocols that ensures that messages cannot be replayed by an attacker without
    detection

    mass collection of internet communications for surveillance
}

\newterm{lawful-hacking}{lawful hacking}{
