Research in this topic elicits objections on many levels. This document lists, classifies, and
responds to them in a short and informal manner.

## Unsorted Complete List of Objections

- Lawful access is a slippery slope
- Access tools are powerful in the wrong hands
- Encryption is the basis for all trust on the internet
- Criminals, being criminals, will flout the law and use encryption anyway
- Usage scope will creep; it will be abused and used for unintended purposes
- Industry doesn't want this for ideological reasons
- Industry doesn't want this for competitiveness reasons
- US legislature is incompetent with tech (see CFAA, telecoms regulation) so cannot be trusted with
    encryption regulation
- [Outdated bad proposal] is hopelessly inadequate
- Government should not have absolute access to data
- When a control is easily circumventable, the only ones hurt are the ignorant
- There is no overlap between crimes severe enough to warrant access and suspects using poor enough
    op-sec for this to help
- Government is already too powerful
- Repressive governments will use this against reformers and activists
- Making technological progress illegal is backward
