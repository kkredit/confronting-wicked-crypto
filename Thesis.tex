\def\Abstract{

The debate has resumed over whether encryption systems should support alternative means of decryption intended for law
enforcement use, called exceptional access (EA). Recent events have renewed interest in EA from the U.S. legislature.
Although EA would reduce digital security and privacy compared to free use of encryption, the quality of the technical
and regulatory approach can make a substantial difference. By considering legislative action as part of the threat
model, security researchers are obliged to engage the topic. In this thesis I aim to clarify and analyze the debate. I
begin by outlining the issue's technical and historical context. In the following chapters I use argument maps to break
down the arguments used by both sides and use data flow diagrams to create threat models for the separate problems of EA
for data in motion and data at rest.
