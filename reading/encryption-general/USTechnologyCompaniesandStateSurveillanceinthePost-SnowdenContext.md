- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Companies respond according to 7 factors:
    1. the internal corporate culture
    2. pressure coming from the human rights field,
    3. the importance of user trust on these companies' businesses
    4. their sensitivity to regulatory changes
    5. the identification of the firm managers to the power elite
    6. the firm's dependence on public procurements
    7. the existence of criminal sanctions for non-cooperation

- Technical comments:
- Notes:

US:
>In the US, we first see overt and multi-pronged resistance strategies being staged, which can be read as an instance of
double-dealing (in the sense that commitments to human rights actually reinforced the position of these firms in
the irrespective markets).

c.f., France:
>In France these companies faced a much more antagonist environment, partly resulting from existing public-private
alliances, and their initial attempt at resistance to the expansion of state surveillance capacities was immediately
denounced by government officials as hypocritical, considering their own commercial surveillance practices. This
subsequently led to much less intense and much more discreet forms of resistance.
