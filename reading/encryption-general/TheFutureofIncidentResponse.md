>Way back in the 1990s, I used to say that “security is a process, not a product.” That was a strategic statement about
the fallacy of thinking you could ever be done with security; you need to continually reassess your security posture in
the face of an ever-changing threat landscape.

get to this point, though. The 1990s was the era of protection. Our industry was full of products that would protect
your computers and network. By 2000, we realized that detection needed to be formalized as well, and the industry was
full of detection products and services. This decade is one of response. Over the past few years, we've started seeing
incident response products and services.},
