  abstract = {Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what. This makes cryptography an
inherently {extbackslash}textit\{political\} tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically {
extbackslash}textit\{moral\} dimension. The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral
positioning of cryptography. They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes
a failure of our field. I believe that it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to
resist mass surveillance. I plea for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math,
but, also, to the societal implications of our work.},
