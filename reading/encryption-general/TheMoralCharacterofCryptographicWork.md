- Notes:

>But, despite all these arguments, I am skeptical about rationalist accounts of ethical affronts, be it mass
surveillance or anything else. If we behave morally,it is not because of rational analyses, but an instinctual
preference for liberty, empathy, or companionship. As Schneier points out, animals don’t like to be surveilled because
it makes them feel like prey, while it makes the surveillor feel like—and act like—a predator. I think people know at an
instinctual level that a life in which our thoughts, discourse, and interactions are subjected to constant algorithmic
or human monitoring is no life at all. We are sprinting towards a world that we know, even without rational thought, is
not a place where man belongs.

  abstract = {Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what. This makes cryptography an
inherently {extbackslash}textit\{political\} tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically {
extbackslash}textit\{moral\} dimension. The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral
positioning of cryptography. They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes
a failure of our field. I believe that it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to
resist mass surveillance. I plea for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math,
but, also, to the societal implications of our work.},
