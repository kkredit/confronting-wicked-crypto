  - Initial thought before reading this:
    - On increase-the-cost-to-LEAs type approaches, I just don't think that's the right approach anymore. Many have
        argued that big-time criminals may use additional encryption schemes anyway, so EA would be most helpful for
        local LE. Making it very expensive means only big agencies will have the capability, but they already have
        several technical tools available. And if a lawful hacking technique could get the whole shebang for $5k, would
        they pay $1k per message? And local LE is right where it already was, with no options.

>Tension. In this work, we examine the tension between two essential components of modern societies: the human right to
privacy and the rule of law to provide safety. With regards to encryption, we posit the following:
>1. There exist a few messages whose disclosure would aid public safety and law enforcement.
>2. The vast majority of messages are either irrelevant to public safety or offer insufficient value to outweigh the
individual and public good from privacy.
