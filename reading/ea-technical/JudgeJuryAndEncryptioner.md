  abstract = {We present Judge, Jury and Encryptioner (JJE) an exceptional access scheme for unlocking devices that
does not give unilateral power to any single authority. JJE achieves this by placing final approval to unlock a device
in the hands of peer devices. JJE distributes maintenance of the protocol across a network of "custodians" such as
courts, government agencies, civil rights watchdogs, and academic institutions. Unlock requests, however, can only be
approved by a randomly selected set of recently active peer devices that must be physically located by law enforcement
in order to gain access to the locked device. This requires that law enforcement expend both human and monetary
resources and pay a "social cost" in order to find and request the participation of random device owners in the unlock
process. Compared to other proposed exceptional access schemes, we believe that JJE mitigates the risk of mass
surveillance, law enforcement abuse, and vulnerability to unlawful attackers. While we propose a concrete construction,
our primary goal with JJE is to spur discussion on ethical exceptional access schemes that balance privacy of
individuals and the desires for law enforcement. JJE transparently reveals the use of exceptional access to the public
and enforces a fixed social cost that, we believe, can be an effective deterrent to mass surveillance and abuse.},
