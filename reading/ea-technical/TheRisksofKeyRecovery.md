  abstract = {A variety of "key recovery," "key escrow," and "trusted third-party" encryption requirements have been
suggested in recent years by government agencies seeking to conduct covert surveillance within the changing

and attempts to outline the technical risks, costs, and implications of deploying systems that provide government
access to encryption keys.},
