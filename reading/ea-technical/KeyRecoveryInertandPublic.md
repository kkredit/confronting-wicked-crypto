# Key Recovery: Inert and Public

- Summary:
  - Proposal for key escrow in a public blockchain
  - Inert: difficult to extract keys from
  - Public: key extraction is visible to all parties
- Purpose:
  - Revive technical discussion of EA with a modern proposal
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Cons:
    - Security risk; centralized risk if have a 3rd party
    - Criminals will use the same doors
    - Costly and bad for competitiveness
    - Govt already has plenty of access to communications data
  - Pros:
    - Criminal investigations
  - Some compromise solutions proposed in the 90s (e.g. goos_oblivious_1996)
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - Similar structure to this paper; goes into some history

>Our aim is to explore some ideas for better compromise solutions to key escrow. We are motivated by the observation
that extraordinary access to personal property in the physical world does not receive the same debate and controversy as
extraordinary access in the virtual world. By examining the differences between the virtual and physical world, we are
led to propose some principles for key escrow which we believe can defuse much of the controversy behind earlier key
recovery proposals. Furthermore, we observe that modern techniques, specifically based on ideas from decentralised
cryptocurrencies, allow these principles to be realised in practice.
