# Protocol failure in the escrowed encryption standard

- Summary:
  - The paper that killed the Clipper Chip
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - The paper doesn't just slam the idea, it ends with suggestions for how it could be better implemented!
- Technical comments:
  - Two failures:
    - One allows rogue parties to subvert the Clipper Chip mechanism
    - One (more powerful) allows a single rogue party to subvert the mechanism even with a compliant party
  - The attacks are _not_ broad information disclosure, they are examples of ways to subvert the Clipper Chip mechanism
- Notes:
