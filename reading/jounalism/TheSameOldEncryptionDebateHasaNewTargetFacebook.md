# The Same Old Encryption Debate Has a New Target: Facebook

- Summary:
  - DOJ, AG Barr go after Facebook E2E
  - FB hopes its machine learning, metadata, and user flagging are enough to meet potential EARN IT requirements
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - The DOJ wants access to this data, but is it even allocating the resources necessary to address the problem?
- Technical comments:
  - You can't legislate a technical solution into existence
  - "Facebook made 16.8 million reports to the US National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 2018"
  - With E2E, you still have
    - Metadata
    - Users can flag content on-device
    - The system can flag content on device (not currently implemented; many dangerous unintended consequences if it
      was) -- see callas_2019
  - FB claims/hopes this is enough to meet the possible EARN IT requirements (see newman_2020)
- Notes:

>"When law enforcement officials talk about all of these truly horrific things that they are attempting to investigate
and that they want to compromise encryption to get at, we have to recognize that it would come with serious harms of is
own," EFF's Crocker says. "There really is not a solution that's been proposed that protects the security and privacy of
communications and allows access for law enforcement. There just isn’t a solution that’s been invented in the world that
can do that."
