# The EARN IT Act Is a Sneak Attack on Encryption

- Summary:
  - Good things: policy focused, not a technical prescription
  - Bad things: the very strong presumption is that "sufficient measures" precludes E2E; the cynical take is that this
    is a front for that real goal
  - Conclusion:
    - This is a good bill in form, as it is policy focused, not a technical prescription
    - This bill should not pass, because we don't have the technology yet to take these measures in an acceptably safe
      manner
      - Unless FB is right that this can be done alongside E2E (newman_2019)
    - Better than previous efforts that _are_ technical prescriptions!
  - Further questions:
    - Are the "sufficient measures" are stable, and not under the direct influence of the AG, for example?
- Purpose:
  - Describes the EARN IT Act, and how it is a follow-up to last year's senate encryption hearing (pfefferkorn_2019,
      geller_2019)
  - See also pfefferkorn_2020
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - "EARN IT": tech platforms to "earn" their liability protection by proving they take sufficient measures to stop CSAM
    - Seems rather in-line with the concept of common carriers; you have these rights if you uphold these requirements
  - The fact that experts from all fields provide the definitions of what companies should do is GOOD
  - This is an example of requiring policy outcomes without enforcing technical requirements (one of my suggestions for
    policy makers)
  - The problem is that lawmakers are assuming? forcing? at least, arguing that the "sufficient measures" preclude E2E
  - Problem:
    - "it's kind of a black box. One of my fears is if this were implemented, what’s to stop China from saying 'in
      addition to monitoring for child sex abuse images, turn this on for Uighur freedom activists too.'"
    - Removing liability protection will be a HUGE barrier to entry for online platforms. Maybe FB should be arguing
      harder FOR this.
      - Business idea, if this passes: CSAM countermeasures as a service. Doesn't that sound like hell.
  - It is important that the "sufficient measures" are stable, and not under the direct influence of the AG, for example
- Technical comments:
- Notes:

>EARN IT focuses specifically on Section 230, which has historically given tech companies freedom to expand with minimal
liability for how people use their platforms. Under EARN IT, those companies wouldn't automatically have a liability
exemption for activity and content related to child sexual exploitation. Instead, companies would have to "earn" the
protection by showing that they are following recommendations for combatting child sexual exploitation laid out by a
16-person commission.

>The bill, written by South Carolina Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal,
would create a way for law enforcement officials, attorneys general, online child sexual exploitation survivors and
advocates, constitutional law scholars, consumer protection and privacy specialists, cryptographers, and other tech
experts to collectively decide what digital companies should do to identify and reduce child predation on their
platforms—and then require companies to actually do it.
