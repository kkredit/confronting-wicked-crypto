# US government calls for “responsible” – as in breakable – encryption

- Summary:
  - Overview of verbal skirmishes in the crypto-war
  - NOTE: from 2017
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - This just underlines all the more: it is **security vs security**. Tech people tend to greatly
      emphasize information security. Lawmakers and LEOs tend to greatly emphasize intelligence
      security. Both are needed for public security.
  - Argument: "criminals don’t obey the law. Law abiding citizens would be forced to use hobbled
      encryption while criminals continued to choose the strongest encryption available."
  - Argument: FBI needs to get into phones for 7500 cases
    - Counter: in 2013 alone, 3.1M cell phones were taken. Without strong ecnryption, that would be
        a disaster for crime and privacy.
  - Argument: Encryption is needed for activists and journalists in repressive countries
- Technical comments:
  - Rosenstein's examples of comparable systems:
    - Key management for OS updates, PKI CAs
    - On-device content scanning (like Lawfare idea for CP)
    - Simulcast of messages (guessing he means like a digital wiretap?)
    - Key recovery when user forgets password
  - This brings up good point of the slanderous use of the term "back door" for any EA proposal but
      not when it's a user _feature_
  - Also makes the point that security is already a game of tradeoffs
  - And do we want to appear to be working harder on security that keeps out LEAs while we still
      suck at so many of the fundementals as an industry?
- Notes:
  - Scheier partakes in the unhelpful exagerations, saying that "a certain piece of paper" isn't
      magic and this is mathematically "ridiculous." He certainly has been following this for a long
      time and has heard more of these conversations than I. But if we assume any goodwill on the
      part of lawmakers and LEAs, then we can talk to them and work together on some sort of
      compromise.
    - If we don't compromise, the technical community _will_ lose

>But their philosophical arguments on this are essentially the same – strong encryption jeopardizes
the lives and safety of Americans because it prevents law enforcement from gathering evidence, even
when they have a warrant in hand.

Rosenstein:
>Responsible encryption can involve effective, secure encryption that allows access only with
judicial authorization. Such encryption already exists. Examples include the central management of
security keys and operating system updates; the scanning of content, like your e-mails, for
advertising purposes; the simulcast of messages to multiple destinations at once; and key recovery
when a user forgets the password to decrypt a laptop. No one calls any of those functions a “back
door.” In fact, those capabilities are marketed and sought out by many users.

Schneier
>...for encryption to work well unless there is a certain piece of paper (a warrant) sitting nearby,
in which case it should not work. \p Mathematically, of course, this is ridiculous. The math either
works or it doesn’t. You don’t get an option where the FBI can break encryption but organized crime
can’t. It’s not available technologically.

>To Comey’s assertion that the FBI had custody of 650 phones it could not decrypt (Rosenstein said
that number is now about 7,500 “mobile devices”), Rotenberg noted that in 2013 alone, more than 3.1
million cell phones were stolen. Without strong encryption on those phones, “crime would be much
higher in the United States,” he said.
