- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - This rules (agreeing with the EFF) that the "Foregone conclusion" exception to the 5th amendment
      does not apply to PINs and PWs.
  - From ruling: "This constitutional right is firmly grounded in the 'realization that the
      privilege, while sometimes a shelter to the guilty, is often a protection to the innocent.'"
  - There was a stronger ruling even in Florida
  - Similar cases in Indiana and New Jersey

    - "The foregone conclusion standard keeps cropping up in these compelled-unlocking cases. It
        allows prosecutors to bypass Fifth Amendment protections if the government can show that it
        knows that the defendant knows the passcode to unlock a device."

>The dry facts: A US court has come down in favor of Fifth Amendment protections against forced
disclosure of a 64-character passcode in a child abuse imagery case = an important interpretation of
whether forced password disclosure is the modern equivalent of an unconstitutionally coerced
confession.  
>The gut punch: The defendant is a man previously convicted over distribution and possession of
child abuse imagery who, on the ride over to his arraignment, openly chatted with cops about how
much he likes watching sexual videos featuring 10- to 13-year-old victims.  
>The ruling, handed down last Wednesday, quoted appellant Joseph J. Davis’s response when asked for
his passcode: "It’s 64 characters and why would I give that to you? We both know what’s on there.
It’s only going to hurt me. No f*cking way I’m going to give it to you."
