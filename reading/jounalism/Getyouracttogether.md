# 'Get your act together': Tech companies face bipartisan congressional uproar over encryption

- Summary:
  - Bipartisan anger at tech boils over at Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on encryption
  - Apple and Facebook were present
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - The feelings are bipartisan
  - Despite the deep technical interrelation between encryption and general security, lawmakers say
      EA "isn't about that". Well, EA laws would be!
  - Very imposing words quoted below
  - This year roughly marks a change in emphasis from terrorism to CP
    - This argument is more emotional, though there are increasingly hard facts to back up the scale
        of the CP issue. (See Times article)
  - "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked if Silicon Valley was prepared to accept liability for
      deaths that resulted from investigators’ inability to access encrypted data."
    - Well, as we've seen elsewhere (ACLU and EFF defenses), basic rights are what protect us all,
        and they come under fire in cases like these. It's easy to make people defending those basic
        rights look bad due to the company they appear to hold, but in general they are fighting a
        good fight.
  - Sen. Blackburn: “Catching criminals is never a bad trade-off.”
    - Yes it is.
  - Though nominally for “benefits and risks to public safety and privacy,” senators weren't even
      interested in teh risks...
- Technical comments:
- Notes:

>“My advice to you is to get on with it, because this time next year, if we haven’t found a way that
you can live with, we will impose our will on you,” warned Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham
(R-S.C.), who reversed his 2016 stance on encryption in his opening remarks.

>Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) warned the tech-industry witnesses that if an encryption solution “doesn’t
happen by you, it will happen by Congress.”

>Tech companies need to “get your act together, or we will gladly get your act together for you,”
said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), after noting the bipartisan frustration at the hearing.

>At one point, the witness from Facebook began to caution that encryption was “a very complicated,
technical ... . ” \p Graham cut him off. “Well, it ain’t complicated for me,” he shot back.

>As the hearing concluded, Lee lamented seeing the conversation “descend into a contest over who
loves children and who acts with reckless disregard for them.”
