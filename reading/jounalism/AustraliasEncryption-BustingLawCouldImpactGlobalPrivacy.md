# Australia's Encryption-Busting Law Could Impact Global Privacy

- Summary:
  - Reporting on Australia's encryption law
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Tech companies and products are global; are companies to have multiple versions of the product, or be forced to pull
      out of the market, or add the ability everywhere?
  - The law gives the power for the state to make these requests in secret--not transparent!
  - The law says is does not require systematic vulnerabilities, but may require "selectively introduced", sounding like
      a preference for forced updates or looping into conversations
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - They follow definition of "backdoor" as any route to plaintext besides normal, i.e. EA. EA == backdoor.
  - We should stop using the word "backdoor", as different parties use it differently, and it carries a lot of baggage.
