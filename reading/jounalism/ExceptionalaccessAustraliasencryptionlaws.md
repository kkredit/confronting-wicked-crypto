# Exceptional access: Australia’s encryption laws

- Summary:
  - Basic article on the AU law
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
  - Nice simple definitions:
    - Default encryption: DAR
    - E2E encryption: DIM
    - Anonimized technologies: mask identity of user
- Policy comments:
  - It's not a war over mathematics; "the debate pits the radical idealism of the tech industry
      against the pragmatic realism of the intelligence community."
  - Question: why do people want to hide their data from law enforcement, but not "surveillance
      capitalist" corporations?
    - There are different types of data
    - People are more afraid of _1984_ than _Brave New World_
    - Many people who are anti-EA are probably also anti-surveillance capitalism (maybe)
  - There are already such laws in Britain and France
- Technical comments:
  - Some data!
    - 65% of lawfully intercepted data has some encryption
    - 90% of priority cases have some encryption

- Notes:

>The challenge for the government and private enterprise is to implement a technical solution that
reconciles the national security imperative with personal privacy.

>Encryption is the bedrock of a safe and secure internet. It safeguards government services, the
global digital economy, and communication over some messaging apps. Default encryption protects a
device’s data at rest. End-to-end encryption protects data in transit. Anonymised technologies mask
the identity of individuals online.

> US Congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri: "Congress is good at two things: doing
nothing and overreacting. We’re getting ready to overreact."
