- Summary:
  - PA court declares PINs and PWs protected under 5th amendment

- Policy comments:
  - "Justice Debra Todd said that unlike a blood sample, there is “no physical manifestation” of a
      password. As such, that makes a password testimonial in nature and protected by the Fifth
      Amendment."
    - There is a legal difference between physical evidence and testimonial evidence. Is digital
        content physical? Is the PIN not physically manifested in system memory?
    - "'As a passcode is necessarily memorized, one cannot reveal a passcode without revealing the
        contents of one’s mind,' Todd wrote in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Thomas Saylor and
        Justices Christine Donohue and David Wecht."
    - It's about revealing the contents of one's mind.
  - Rights advocates (here the ACLU and EFF) have strange bedfellows. It looks bad to side with
      those known to be guilty, but the rights of the weak are the rights of us all. Rights matter
      most when they need to be used.
