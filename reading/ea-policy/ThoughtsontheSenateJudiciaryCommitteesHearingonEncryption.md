# Thoughts on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Hearing on Encryption

- Summary:
  - Well written response to Dec '19 senate hearing
  - Quite a cynical take
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Argument: lawmakers will _not_ back off E2E if they ever get DE EA
  - UK has been more focused on DIM and E2E while US has been more focused on DAR and DE, though the
      US has unclearly hinted interest in this area
  - (A "solution" would probably have to offer something for both)
  - Author points out that gov't frequently reneges on promises to compromise
    - E.g. CALEA carve-out for information services which is now under attack
    - But, honestly, the nature of "information services" and the web has changed drastically since
        the 90s, and policy has to evolve with the environment...
  - Points out that gov't likes to substitute flip-of-a-switch surveillance for actually funding
      work
    - MLAT situation
    - CSAM/cybercrimes situation at DHS (see also NYT CSAM article)
    - This is a danger! Solutions that involve "economics" or significant labor on gov't's part will
        either face up-front resistance or inevitably be underfunded
  - LEA problems with digital evidence gathering in order of precedence:
    - figuring out which service providers held relevant data
    - then getting it from those providers
    - Unknown order
      - budget constraints
      - training
      - encrypted data
  - There is another bill right now that addresses _those_ problems, which are better first resorts
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - The senators used it to beat up on tech execs, not really listen
  - The techies talked about the technical side, which doesn't translate to senators as all
  - This makes the DOJ's and LEA's PR campaign on CSAM look quite successful
  - The lawmakers did a bit of a bait-and-switch
    - The hearing was supposed to be about CSAM and E2E
    - Many senators turned the attention back to DE
  - This may be an example of congress avoiding responsibility, particularly with budgeting
    - Based on budgetary comments in 'Policy' section above
    - Now, avoiding "responsibility" isn't always a bad thing if we don't want the gov't to do
        everything! But,
    - Do this with healthcare: employers, insurers, you provide healthcare
    - Do this with retirement: employers, wall street, you handle retirement
    - Doing this with intelligence: we could properly fund LEAs, but no, tech, you make this easy

>It is a classic negotiation strategy to ask for more than you actually want, then let yourself be
bargained down to a “reasonable compromise” that just happens to be what you really wanted. Anything
else you get on top of that is gravy. Mandating messaging encryption backdoors would be a
nice-to-have for Vance, but by conceding on end-to-end encrypted messaging for the time being, he
gives the appearance that the law enforcement community is engaging in earnest, good-faith
negotiation toward the “mature, adult, reasonable, balanced, middle-ground compromise” on encryption
that he and his colleagues are always demanding from device makers, platforms, app developers,
cryptographers, and civil libertarians (who realize there is no middle ground). If Vance comes
across as willing to give up something in the spirit of finding middle ground, he can make Facebook
and Apple look even more unreasonable than the SJC members accused them of being.
