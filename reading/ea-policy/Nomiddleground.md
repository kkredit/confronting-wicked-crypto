# No middle ground: Moving on from the crypto wars

- Summary:
  - EU-focused state of affairs in privacy, security, and EA (large focus on lawful hacking)
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - The suggest that "Privacy advocates and security researchers are destined to win the fight on stronger encryption
    and against key escrow, but they will lose the war on security."
  - Process
    - EA won't pass for technological and political reasons
    - Govts will work together and LEAs will turn to hacking
    - The exploit market will become distorted towards governments
    - The privacy and security alliance will shatter--privacy advocates will advocate legalized hacking, which is very
      bad for security!
      - I'm not sure I buy this step. Will privacy advocates go this way?
    - Users will be the biggest losers. They will pay for the exploit-device-security arms race

>First, the US and European governments will lose the encryption debate – because of the absence of a viable technical
and feasible political solution – and will inevitably resort to treating tech companies as non-cooperative actors that
undermine national security. Second, in the short term, government agencies will increasingly turn inward while
purchasing exploit kits from third party companies to circumvent encryption. In the long term, government agencies will,
on a technical level, cooperate more closely domestically (namely, through convergence between law enforcement and
intelligence agencies) and across national borders (by partnering with government agencies abroad). Third, the
vulnerability market will increasingly be distorted, with governments paying handsomely for vulnerabilities and exploit
kits, pricing out traditional bug-bounty programmes, and changing the dynamics for responsible vulnerability disclosure.
Fourth, the natural alliance between privacy advocates and security researchers will shatter: privacy advocates will
endorse the government’s targeted approach to circumventing encryption to combat crime, while security researchers will
rail against government agencies exploiting and withholding knowledge of vulnerabilities in common software and
hardware. And it remains unclear what might happen if government agencies lose their exploit kits to a hostile nation
state or cyber criminal group. And, fifth, users will be the biggest losers. They will feel obliged to purchase ever
more secure and expensive devices while government agencies devote more and more resources – taxpayer money – to
breaking into them.
