  - History outline
    - Crypto used by militaries, govts for a long time.
    - 1976: Entered the public sphere with public key crypto; in a few years govts were already seeing it as a problem
    - 1993: Clinton white house introduces Clipper Chip, "providing the public with strong cryptographic tools without
      sacrificing the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access unencrypted versions of those
      communications". The debate begins.
    - 1994: Matt Blaze discovers a flaw in the chip design, and the chip proposal is dead. (blaze_protocol_1994)
    - 1990s: The idea for EA lives on; key escrow systems are the dominant approach.
    - 1996: Crypto tools no longer considered munitions; may be exported. The US didn't want foreign entities to have
      strong encryption, but it was increasingly available anyway, and locking the US out of foreign markets. There
      remained limits on key length.
    - 1997: "There was an overwhelming amount of evidence against moving ahead with any key escrow schemes".
    - 1999: All limits on key length are removed.
