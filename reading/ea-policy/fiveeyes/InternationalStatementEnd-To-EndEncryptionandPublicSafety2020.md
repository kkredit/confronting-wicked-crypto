# International Statement: End-To-End Encryption and Public Safety

- Summary:
  - Five-eyes + Japan and India statement on Encryption and E2E
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - Strongest language since 2018
  - Emphasized cooperation with industry
  - Heavy emphasis on CSAM

>We reiterate that data protection, respect for privacy and the importance of encryption as technology changes and
global Internet standards are developed remain at the forefront of each stateâ€™s legal framework. However, we challenge
the assertion that public safety cannot be protected without compromising privacy or cyber security.

- Depends what you mean by compromise. We **will** have to make compromises.

>While this statement focuses on the challenges posed by end-to-end encryption, that commitment applies across the range
of encrypted services available, including device encryption, custom encrypted applications and encryption across
integrated platforms.

- They seem somewhat reasonable given benefit of the doubt until here. We cannot solve the "problem" of custom encrypted
  applications without extreme laws. Addressing that is far out of a reasonable current scope.
