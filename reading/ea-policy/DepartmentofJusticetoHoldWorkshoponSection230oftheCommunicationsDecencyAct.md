>Proponents claim that Section 230 immunity led to the flourishing of the internet and the creation
of the online ecosystem we see today. Opponents, on the other hand, believe that the broad
interpretation of Section 230 has prevented solutions to a variety of problems that continue to
proliferate to the detriment of victims, law enforcement, and civil discourse. The Justice
Department intends to examine these issues and identify and discuss potential solutions.
