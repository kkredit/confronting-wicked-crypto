- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:

- Technical comments:

  - The Four Horsemen:
    - Terrorists
    - Pedophiles (child pornographers)
    - Drug dealers
    - Money launderers (traditional; or kidnappers, Schneier)

>Let me be clear. None of us who favor strong encryption is saying that child exploitation isn't a serious crime, or a
worldwide problem. We're not saying that about kidnapping, international drug cartels, money laundering, or terrorism.
We are saying three things.
>  - One, that strong encryption is necessary for personal and national security.
>  - Two, that weakening encryption does more harm than good.
>  - And three, law enforcement has other avenues for criminal investigation than eavesdropping on communications and
    stored devices.
