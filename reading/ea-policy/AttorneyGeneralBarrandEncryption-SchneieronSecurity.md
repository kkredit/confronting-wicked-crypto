# Attorney General Barr and Encryption - Schneier on Security

- Summary:
  - The AG is recognizing security-vs-security over security-vs-privacy
  - Talk is on DIM again
  - Differentiating classes of tech is not useful
  - Security against general attackers is still more important
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - This is a development: instead of the wrong security-vs-privacy, we're talking about
      security-vs-security
  - The lines between military and corporate and consumer tech don't really exist in this realm
  - On security-vs-security, Schneier sides with security-from-everyone-attacking over
      security-from-those-we-can't-access
  - AG argument:
    - AG: balance 99% security to allow 80% LE access, not 99.5% security for 0% LE access
    - I don't think those numbers accurately reflect the current state of cybersecurity. Average
        companies and individuals are _not_ secure against 99% of attacks.
  - The lack of data from LEAs makes the problem very hard to gauge.
- Technical comments:
  - Barr is bringing the conversation back to data-in-motion
- Notes:

  - A quote from Barr: "Some hold this view dogmatically, claiming that it is technologically
      impossible to provide lawful access without weakening security against unlawful access. But,
      in the world of cybersecurity, we do not deal in absolute guarantees but in relative risks.
      All systems fall short of optimality and have some residual risk of vulnerability."
    - This is true.
  - Barr goes on to differentiate between military, corporate, and private-strength encryption. This
      is a bad argument. To differentiate this way makes little sense, would be hard to enforce,
      assuming this would require laws limiting strength at different levels. As Schneier says,
      "There's no longer a difference between consumer tech and government tech -- it's all the same
      tech."

>I think this is a major change in government position. Previously, the FBI, the Justice Department
and so on had claimed that backdoors for law enforcement could be added without any loss of
security. They maintained that technologists just need to figure out howÂ­ -- an approach we have
derisively named "nerd harder."  
>With this change, we can finally have a sensible policy conversation. Yes, adding a backdoor
increases our collective security because it allows law enforcement to eavesdrop on the bad guys.
But adding that backdoor also decreases our collective security because the bad guys can eavesdrop
on everyone. This is exactly the policy debate we should be having -- not the fake one about whether
or not we can have both security and surveillance.
