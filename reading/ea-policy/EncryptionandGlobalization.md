  abstract = {During the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s, encryption was quite likely the single most
passionate area of legal and policy debate. Law enforcement and national security agencies supported limits on the
export of strong encryption, fearing that encryption would block their ability to protect public safety and national
security. Supporters of strong encryption most basically argued that encryption was essential to securing communication
over the Internet. During the “crypto wars” of the 1990’s, government policy initially supported surveillance,
with the Clipper Chip proposal and a policy of escrowing encryption keys. The administration shifted position in 1999,
allowing export largely without restrictions. After this shift in policy, encryption law and policy largely faded from
view.},
