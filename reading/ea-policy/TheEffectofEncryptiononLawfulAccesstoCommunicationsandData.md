>According to a recent report [lewis_2017], more than half of the world's population lives in countries where strong
end-to-end encryption is already illegal without some sort of backdoor or assistance for the authorities.

“Going Dark” and the “Crypto Wars” of the 1990s, but much has changed since then. First, the Internet has
become central to global economic activity, politics, and security. The security environment has changed, as we face
much more aggressive state actors in espionage. The Snowden revelations in 2013 damaged the credibility of U.S. tech
companies operating abroad, and any requirement that they facilitate U.S. government access to their customers’
communications could affect their international competitiveness. Terrorists and criminals find creative ways to
leverage the latest technologies to evade law enforcement. Technology continues to evolve, making unrecoverable
encryption easier for individuals to obtain and use. Furthermore, any U.S. policy on encryption might set a precedent
that other countries would be tempted to follow. While the debate thus far has pitted privacy and individual security
against the critical task of stopping criminals and terrorists, there may be technical and policy solutions that can
balance national security and public safety with protection of privacy, civil liberties, and a functioning global
Internet ecosystem.},
