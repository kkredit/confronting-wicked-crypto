# Clipper Meets Apple vs. FBI—A Comparison of the Cryptography Discourses from 1993 and 2016

- Summary:
  - Describes the nature of EA debates in the 1990's and now
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - Three classes of arguments are widely employed now
    - Technical/security
    - Economic (cost to implement, decrease in U.S. competitiveness)
    - Rights/privacy
  - One big argument that has been widely used in both wars:
    - Others will get in, too
    - This is important to both security and privacy

>Whereas the government predominantly uses national security-related arguments, the counter-discourse is more
heterogeneous. There are three types of argument. Technical arguments state that government access makes encryption
systems less secure and are mostly put forward by the technology and science community. Economic arguments argue against
government interference in the market and the costs of the proposal. Finally, there are civil liberty arguments that
revolve around privacy and mistrust of the expansion of state power and are uttered by libertarians. There are also
several other arguments that overlap or do not necessarily fall into either group. Their common denominator is that the
government wants to interfere with the products of private companies (24x) in terms of hardware with Clipper and
software with Apple. The metaphor of choice is that the government wants to create a “backdoor” (25x) in an otherwise
secure system. Libertarians see this as an expansion of government authority, or with the words of Apple CEO Tim Cook as
“government overreach” (20x) and thus as a potential threat (Cook, 2016a). Business actors are more afraid of the
potential future effects of the government regulating encryption, which might result in the widespread use of inferior
technology (15x).

  abstract = {This article analyzes two cryptography discourses dealing with the question of
whether governments should be able to monitor secure and encrypted communication, for example via
security vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems. The Clipper chip debate of 1993 and the FBI vs.
Apple case of 2016 are analyzed to infer whether these discourses show similarities in their
arguments and to draw lessons from them. The study is based on the securitization framework and
analyzes the social construction of security threats in political discourses. The findings are that
the arguments made by the proponents of exceptional access show major continuities between the two
cases. In contrast, the arguments of the critics are more diverse. The critical arguments for
stronger encryption remain highly relevant, especially in the context of the Snowden revelations.
The article concludes that we need to adopt a more general cyber security perspective, considering
the threat of cyber crime and state hacking, when debating whether the government should be able to
weaken encryption.},
