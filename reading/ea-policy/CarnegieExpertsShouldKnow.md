# Carnegie Experts Should Know: Defending Encryption Isn't an "Absolutist" Position

- Summary:
  - EFF attacks Carnegie Institute for Peace's "Moving the Debate Forward" paper as "deeply flawed"
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Calling encryption a "challenge" is disingenuous. Are private unrecorded conversations a
      "challenge"?
    - What is the difference? This is recorded information, evidence, that _does exist_, they just
        can't reach... unlike information that is never recorded...
  - LEAs already are net-benefitting from technology due to the huge amount of surveillance tech
      that is cropping up around us. Intenet connected-everything and cloud services being huge.
- Technical comments:
  - They call the Carnegie proposal (which is sparse in details) "a version of the discredited “key
      escrow” scheme", but it is different. Not all schemes that produce extra keys are made equal.
      It is not the same old proposal from 25 years ago, that truly is discredited.
  - They describe the prop with fairness, then slanderously label it a "backdoor", and the rest is a
      foregone conclusion.
  - Threats:
    - Misuse of the extra key:
      - Criminal who steals the key
      - Rogue government that subverts the legal process
      - Inside actor
    - Spread of the technology to countries that will abuse it
      - They're gonna pass their own laws anyway...
    - Forced malicious updates will cause people to avoid updating (Carnegie and EFF agree this is
        bad)
- Notes:
  - The EFF frequently shows strong disdain

Disdain example:
>Encryption is under a new set of attacks by law enforcement, who continue to seek a magic bullet—a
technological backdoor that could circumvent encryption, but somehow not endanger privacy and
security more broadly.

>It’s hard to search for “middle ground” in the debate when middle ground is, by definition, a
security flaw.

Really good:
>We can’t deny that in certain cases, providing exceptional access to law enforcement will provide
helpful evidence. But constantly calling encryption a “challenge” to criminal investigations is a
circular and disingenuous argument. It’s not much different than the “challenge” to law enforcement
presented by any unrecorded, face-to-face conversation between two human beings. On this basis, any
human interaction that is not overseen and recorded for law enforcement could be cited as an
investigative “challenge.” Privacy does present challenges, but it’s indispensable to our lives.
Without privacy, we won’t have the free expression and free debate we need for democracy to thrive.
