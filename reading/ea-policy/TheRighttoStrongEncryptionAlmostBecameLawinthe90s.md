    - 1996: Rep. Bob Goodlatte introduces SAFE Act "'to affirm the rights of United States persons to use and sell
        encryption and to relax export controls on encryption.' It included provisions that would have barred the
        government from creating a mandatory key escrow system and would also have removed export restrictions on most

    - 1996-1999: SAFE Act is prop0sed several times, has hearings, and gains support.
    - 1999: Clinton administration executively implements almost all of SAFE Act proposals, and the bill is dropped (!).
