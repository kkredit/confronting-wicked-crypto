# Wicked Crypto

- Summary:
  - Basically my thesis, but more policy focused. He analyzes crypto as a "wicked problem"!
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Encryption both enhances and undermines public safety (security vs security)
  - Silicon Valley, faced by the threat of regulation from both liberal and autocratic regimes, has the opportunity to
      tackle the problem first and set a global precedent. This is opportunity!
  - As similarly argued in his rozenshtein_2019, EA would be a boon for smaller-time crime
    - Advanced criminals or users could use alternative, impossible to stomp-out encryption schemes
    - Bigger criminals have bigger, well funded agencies that can afford long investigations and lawful hacking
    - Smaller criminals are less likely to stray from common technology platforms
  - EA is a wicked problem (I swear I came to this conclusion before reading this paper)
    - "There is no agreement on goals"
      - A good description about conflict of underlying values: what do you even mean by "security"?
        - Public safety, or
        - information security?
    - "Information is Uncertain and Diffuse"
      - There is convincing evidence that we are not currently capable of reasonably secure EA; is this cause for more
          research, or giving up? He argues the former:
        - Serious researchers are still working on the problem, and could have a breakthrough
        - "Antipathy toward government in the technology industry and security-research community may be scaring away
            some researchers  from  tackling  the  problem.
          - Bart Preneel, a very well respected cryptographer, has argued that the topic should not be taboo
      - He argues that lawful hacking is the only other alternative, and that also has negative side effects on infosec
      - The 'results' of CWI don't directly apply, for several reasons. He also mentions ubiquity as a big reason.
    - "The Problem Cannot Be Fully or Permanently Solved"
      - The landscape is constantly shifting
      - In the interim of the crypto wars, the govt was focusing on access to VoIP and other access capabilities
  - Lessons, given EA is a wicked problem:
    - "Beware easy answers"
      - "EA Mandates"
      - "“Going Dark” vs. “A Golden Age of Surveillance”"
    - "Focus on Imperfect Solutions: The Case of Lawful Hacking"
    - "Invest in Knowledge Production"
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - Contains a nice little (very high level) intro to crypto and EA

>We are in a critical period for this issue: public opinion is split on whether companies should design their systems to
permit law-enforcement access;11technology companies can no longer assume a hands-off, deregulatory environment; and the
looming specter of foreign regulation from liberal and autocratic regimes alike gives the government and Silicon Valley
an incentive to resolve the encryption issue one way or the other, thereby setting a global precedent. My hope is that
this article will nudge the discussion away from oppositional, all-or-nothing analyses of short-term proposals and
toward a higher-level, longer-term approach that can find common ground among the various sides.

>It is impossible to know the precise extent to which encryption frustrates law-enforcement investigations, both because
law-enforcement agencies are only beginning to collect accurate statistics, and because one can never be sure of how an
investigation would have proceeded in the absence of encryption. But the top-line conclusion is clear: as a report by
the National Academies notes, “widespread encryption is having a serious and growing negative impact on the ability of
law enforcement to collect relevant plaintext [i.e., unencrypted data].”

Excellent quote!

>A diagnosis of wickedness can bring about policy humility, which has two additional useful consequences. It may lead us
to take seriously proposals that might otherwise be discarded as imperfect, second best, or non-ideal, so that the
unobtainable perfect does not crowd out the attainable good (or even middling). And this sense of humility may lead
parties on various sides of the issue to view each other’s proposals and perspectives more charitably, and to better
appreciate the value of compromise.

>Bart Preneel, a renowned Belgian cryptographer whose research in encryption has made him both a hero to the
information-security and privacy communities and a thorn to law enforcement, encouraged cryptographers to research
secure exceptional-access systems (in addition to generally improving the state of information security).

>On the other hand, no solution will fully prevent criminals from using encryption that law enforcement cannot defeat,
because there are hundreds of encrypted hardware and software services, both in the United States and abroad, that an
individual seeking encrypted communications or storage could use.68 Even the most extreme government-access proposals
would not be able to reach every encrypted product in the United States, not to mention foreign products. This does not
mean that attempts to regulate encryption are fruitless. The vast majority of criminals are unsophisticated and will
stick to the most popular consumer products (which could be more easily regulated).69 And the resources freed up by
easier access to those criminals’ data could be used on the expensive, one-off techniques—such as lawful
hacking70—necessary to access the encrypted data of more sophisticated criminals. But law enforcement will still
frequently be stymied in its quest for data and so will continuously push for farther-reaching regulation of
encryption.

>As the political scientist Charles E. Lindblom explained in a seminal article on public administration: “Policy is not
made once and for all; it is made and re-made endlessly. Policy-making is a process of successive approximation to some
desired objectives in which what is desired itself continues to change under reconsideration.”71 The problem of
law-enforcement access to encrypted data typifies this chronic aspect of the most difficult policy problems.

  abstract = {Encryption safeguards our digital and physical selves. But when encryption impedes law-enforcement
investigations, it can undermine public safety. Can we design a system such that our data is secure against malicious
actors while simultaneously accessible to the government pursuant to lawful process?This article, prepared for the UC
Irvine Law Review's symposium on gender, equality, and technology, tries to advance the debate over government access
to encrypted data. First, it explains that, although government access to encrypted data is publicly framed as
primarily a national-security issue, its biggest public-safety effects are on state and local criminal investigations.
Second, drawing on planning and public-administration theory, this article argues that government access to encrypted
data is best conceptualized as a "wicked problem": one where the goals are unclear, the information is incomplete, and
the solutions are always provisional. Third, it applies the wicked-problem framework to generate a set of lessons and
policy proposals, including: embracing partial solutions like government hacking of encrypted devices, while
recognizing the drawbacks and limitations of such approaches; developing policies to generate knowledge about the
problem in both the public and private sectors, and creating institutional and legal contexts that promote cooperation
rather than antagonism between the government and the technology community.},
