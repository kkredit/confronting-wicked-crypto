# DOJ and FBI Show No Signs of Correcting Past Untruths in Their New Attacks on Encryption

- Summary:
  - EFF attacks AG and FBI comments on EA
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Argument: Don't listen to AG and FBI because they are using poor arguments
  - This is dangerous! This is partisan. It says "don't even listen to the other side, because
      they're wrong, so it's a waste of time."
  - This also assumes that lawmakers will
    - Agree with you
    - Understand a technical topic
    - Be swayed by reason (and assumes that reason is totally on your side)
  - They bemoan the lack of candor about data
    - This is a valid and frustrating point
    - We need candor--who will make the first step?
  - The FBI reported 8K phones in 2017 alone, and later admitted that was inflated due to a
      "programming error"
- Technical comments:
  - They seem to encourage the "hacking back" solution, which has its own problems
- Notes:

>Last week, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray chose to spend some of
their time giving speeches demonizing encryption and calling for the creation of backdoors to allow
the government access to encrypted data. You should not spend any of your time listening to them.  
Don’t be mistaken; the threat to encryption remains high. Australia and the United Kingdom already
have laws in place that can enable those governments to undermine encryption, while other countries
may follow. And it’s definitely dangerous when senior U.S. law enforcement officials talk about
encryption the way Barr and Wray did.  
The reason to ignore these speeches is that DOJ and FBI have not proven themselves credible on this
issue. Instead, they have a long track record of exaggeration and even false statements in support
of their position. That should be a bar to convincing anyone—especially Congress—that government
backdoors are a good idea.
