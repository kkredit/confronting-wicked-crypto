Abstract:
>It is often assumed that privacy and security are alternative values, which cannot be pursued together. Hence, the
strength of the “nothing-to-hide argument”: if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. Besides, ensuring the
security of the network itself is said to actually require a detailed analysis of network flows. Reasonable expectations
of privacy should thus progressively disappear in cyberspace. While it is true that enforcement of legal rules is a real
challenge when communications are transmitted through the means of a borderless network, the evolution of the case law
of the European Court of Human Right recently followed by the Court of Justice of the European Union does show that the
right to respect for private life should have important implications online and in particular should significantly
restrict the systematic collection and retention of content and traffic data by both public and private actors such as
Internet service providers. At a time at which data-gathering and data-matching technologies are more sophisticated than
ever, as illustrated by Snowden’s revelations, it is crucial to fully comprehend the interaction between the protection
of privacy and the furtherance of security in order to set appropriate limits to surveillance practices. The purpose of
this chapter is therefore twofold: first, to shed light upon the European approach to privacy and explain the interplay
between privacy law, data protection law and data retention law; second, to explain how the values of privacy and
security should be balanced together and in particular how privacy law should serve to scrutinise the appropriateness of
measures implemented to ensure the security of the social group at large.

>To conclude, it should be clear by now that the values of privacy and security cannot simply be conceived as being in
blunt opposition without any possibility of reconciliation. In fact, it is likely that in the end, these values should
be conceived as complementary rather than contradictory.
