Abstract:

>Since 1978, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) has governedUnited States intelligence gathering for
national security purposes. Enacted in response to the Watergate-era civil rights violations and revelations of a Senate
investigation headed by Senator Frank Church that other presidential administrations had authorized similar warrantless
surveillance, FISA established a statutory framework for national security surveillance. Understanding FISA contributes
to the study of criminal justice policymaking because law enforcement and intelligence communities view it as an
important tool for combatting espionage and terrorism. This article examines the enactment of FISA from the perspective
of symbolic politics.
