# Privacy and Surveillance Post-9/11

- Summary:
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Privacy is the US is eroding
  - Happening in part because laws have not kept up
    - ECPA was specific about where the data lives, but that changes with technology trends, so it became quickly
        outdated and overly permissive
  - Data obtained in violation of ECPA is still permissable in court?? See quote #1 below
  - The PATRIOT Act diminished protections against domestic surveillance initially built into FISA
  - "NSLs are authorized by four separate statutes, each of which was expanded by section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act."
  - The FISA Amendments Act was to replaced GWB's warrentless wiretapping, but "expands the government’s authority to
      monitor Americans’ international communications", which in online communications, is almost all
  - The Govt has been shown to repeatedly flout what restrictions exist (and this was pre-Snowden)
  - The "third party" doctrine under the 4th amendment is outdated--electronic data is almost always held by third
      parties
  - Pattern--executive overreach, congress doesn't check them and provides "after-the-fact immunity", and courts don't
      hold cases due to lack of standing.
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - Examples of outdated doctrines and laws
    - ECPA data locality rules and expectations
    - The "third party" doctrine under the 4th amendment
    - The doctrine of standing as it relates to FISA, NSLs

>Both the Fourth Amendment and a domestic wiretapping statute provide for an exclusionary remedy: If a law enforcement
official obtains information in violation of a defendant’s constitutional privacy rights or the statute, that
information usually cannot be used in court. The same rule, however, does not apply to electronic information obtained
in violation of ECPA. Without an exclusionary rule, there is little deterrence against government overreaching.

>In the national security surveillance area, however, that system of intertwined oversight has failed. The executive
routinely acts outside of the law, as its own reports confirm; Congress fails to curb those violations and even ratifies
them with ever-more-expansive authorizations and after-the-fact immunity; and the judiciary for the most part has
refused to say what the law is, instead dismissing the most significant challenges to surveillance on procedural
grounds.

>Courts must assume a more direct role in overseeing government surveillance. They must not adopt theories of standing
that effectively immunize surveillance from judicial review. The purpose of the standing doctrine has always been to
ensure that courts adjudicate the right cases, not to prevent courts ever from adjudicating the lawfulness of executive
action.
