# Judicial policy making and the modern state: how the courts reformed America's prisons

- Summary:
  - Legal scholars argue that judicial policy making is real, going on to describe how it works
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - The judiciary has three roles; the first two are fully accepted, the third is a matter of controversy
    1. Determine facts
    2. Interpret authoritative legal texts
    3. Make new public policy
  - Admitting the policy making role is "generally treated as either harsh realism or a predicate to condemnation"
    - Political scientists descriptively see it as "harsh realism"
    - Legal scholars prescriptively see it as either a legal error or an unavoidable reality that undercuts the
        integrity of the entire process
    - Judges themselves deny it exists (mostly by saying that the policy making is "interpretation")
      - In modern times, because it's undesirable to be seen as an unelected policy maker and political actor
      - In past times, to claim that they were not a threat to the monarchy's authority
  - This book treats it as a mundane, legitimate function that emerges naturally from the courts' role in our state
    - Regardless of whether one thinks this good or bad, it is useful to acknowledge and study
    - A bit of an existentialist approach: it exists and is practiced regularly, so it is by definition legitimate
  - Three methods of policymaking (p5)
    1. Classical analytic method; each step has its own approaches, e.g. cost-benefit analysis (loosely based on natural
        sciences)
      a. Define the problem
      b. Identify a goal
      c. Generate a range of alternatives for achieving that goal
      d. Select the alternative that seems most promising
      e. Implement the selected alternative
    2. Incremental intuitive decision making, or "the science of muddling through" (Charles Lindblom)
      - Puts the above sequence out of order; even, makes (e) the only conscious step, relying on on intuition for
          everything else.
      - "As Lindblom's sobriquet suggests, it often led to a considerable muddle." p 298
    3. The "hermeneutic circle" of mutual interpretation of the whole and the part by one another (loosely based on
        the humanities and aesthetic theory)
      - Kind of like muddling through, but intrinsically self-reflective and iterative; more conscious
    4. ME: OODA!: loosely based on military strategy
  - Various arguments and counterarguments regarding policymaking as a distinct function
  - Introduction of prison reform as a strong case for policy making
  - Now, just because it happens doesn't mean it's justified. Policy making in prison reform violates
    - Federalism, since federal rules were imposed on an area supposed to be under state control
    - Separation of powers, since courts created a management and implementation bureaucracy
    - Rule of law (to put it strongly), since courts reneged on precedent despite no change in circumstances or facts
      - Violation of "stare decesis"
  - Mystery: what drove this change in prison reform jurisprudence? There was no landmark SCOTUS case. This seemingly
      spontaneously emerged from a huge bloc of federal courts and judges.
  - How and why did judges violate the above "sacred" principles? They are out of date (!)
    - Federalism and separation of powers are, for better or for worse or for neither, outdated and little respected
    - Rule of law is still relevant, and perhaps more important, but its meaning must be clarified
    - In the judiciary, does it really mean limiting judicial action to interpretation? The authors argue no.
      - All legal doctrines have a history and a beginning, usually easily identifiable in case history
      - The creation of legal doctrines constitutes judicial policy making
      - So any interpretation-only theory of law precludes the creation of new doctrines, and futhermore means that any
          established doctrine truly has an illegitimate beginning!
  - So, "Judges act as policymakers because policy making has become the characteristic mode of governmental action.
      They ignore the apparent constraints because the validity of those constraints has been eroded by precisely the
      same developments."
  - Collectively and personally held ideas and conceptions measurably influence governmental actions, including judges'.
      Models that only recognize economics, power, institutional momentum, etc are incomplete.
- Judicial reform of the prisons amounted to a wholesale rejection of federalism, they argue, a concept on the
  practical decline for ages, though we still give it lip service.
- **Why did this happen? What drove the judiciary to execute this reform, and how would it look in surveillance and privacy?**
  - How? Judicial policy making is a necessary reality; perfect fidelity to precedent and pure interpretation is not
      possible, and would preclude the very origination of legal doctrine.
  - Why? Federal judges ultimately rejected federalism (see ch 5) and saw themselves as the only federal authority
      with jurisdiction over the problem of southern plantation prisons.
  - Why then? Federalism had long been on the decline, and the judiciary saw prisoners as "the last minority" whose
      rights were being trampled. This was a late-stage continuation of the civil rights movement.
  - How was it implemented? administrative, bureaucratic oversight.
  - How would it look for surveillance and privacy? The judiciary is coming around to ideas that classes of digital data
      are fundamentally different that non-digital data. They will likely want to create national standards as to what
      classes of data are subject to different kinds of search. Unlike prison reform, this is an area that attracts
      congressional attention, so the courts won't lead the way, but they will limit the kind of legislation that gets
      proposed. If no legislation is proposed or passed (likely in our increasingly dysfunctional government), they may
      be compelled to establish more of a policy making role. The nature of their rules is likely to be very results
      oriented technically, though they could be detailed about warrant requirements, the legal process, and the scope
      of data.

- Notes:
  - Definitions
    - Judicial policy making: "policy making by a judge" (p4)
    - Policy making: "the process by which officials exercise power and the basis of their judgement that their actions
        will produce socially desireable results" (p5)
      - This comes from Ronald Dworkin (an opponent of judicial policy making), mentioned in a few other readings
      - "the leading liberal scholar of western jurisprudence", per matyas_incommensurability_2018
      - The subject of levy_ronald_2017
    - Interpretation: "the process by which public officials exercise power on the basis of a preexisting legal source
        that they regard as authoritative" (p5)
    - Federalism: "states have the right to make their own decisions in a variety of fields"
