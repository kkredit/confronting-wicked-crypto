# Computer-Supported Argument Maps as a Policy Memory

- Summary:
  - 2007
- Purpose:
  - A study of the use of argument maps in informing public debate
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Democracies require participation to work, but it's hard to participate when we have an overload of info
  - Visualization maps can simplify that info
  - Cons
    - Objectivity is a problem, but not any more so than arguments in written or spoken form
    - There is no guarantee that people would use or be swayed by them
    - People need to be able to understand them (but it's not too hard, and many are visual learners like me!)
  - Pros
    - It has show useful as applied to wicked problems (see quote 3)
- Technical comments:
  - The differentiate between
    - Overview Maps
    - Dialogue Maps
    - Argument Maps
- Notes:

Abstract
>This paper investigates to what extent Computer Supported Argument Visualisation can be designed to encourage debate
and deliberation by citizens on public issues. Such argument maps use icons and arrows to represent the structure of a
series of related viewpoints, reducing the amount of text necessary to convey the ideas, thereby clarifying the issue
under consideration. Argument maps have the potential to provide a readily accessible medium by which citizens can
follow and join in public debates on policy issues. In this paper we describe our approach, type of maps we have chosen
to use and then demonstrate the potential of a collection of maps to form a ‘policy memory’ to support policy
development. Our case study is the development of the ‘Smoking in Public Places’ policy in the Scottish Parliament. Our
overall aim is to engage citizens in democratic decision-making leading to better policy-making and a more engaged
citizenry.

This is much less true today, with Argdown!
>Currently the creation of maps is largely performed manually via the CSAV software and thereby is quite time consuming.
The corollary of this is that the maps will be expensive to produce as well as there being a lag period between the end
of the debate and the appearance of the map.

On use in political debates of political problems
>The use of argument visualisation in a political context is in its infancy. It has a proven track-record in simplifying
complex arguments, of addressing ‘wicked’ problems and structuring large amounts of information to reveal informative
patterns of behaviour. There is sufficient semblance between politics and these areas to warrant attempting to extend
the advantages into the political domain. It has shown itself capable of contributing to conflict resolution and drawing
together groups constructively to produce solutions to problems.
