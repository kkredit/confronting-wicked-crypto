  abstract = {Miss G. Mattel, whose exploratory work has contributed significantly to the results outlined in this
paper. ISSUES AS ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS) are meant to support
coordination and planning of political decision processes. IBIS guides the identification, structuring, and settling of
issues raised by problem-solving groups, and provides information pertinent to the discourse. It is linked to
conventional documentation systems but also activates other sources. Elements of the system are topics, issues,
questions of fact, positions, arguments, and model problems. The logic of issues, the subsystems of IBIS, and their
rules of operation are outlined. Three manually operated versions of IBIS are in experimental operation by governmental
agencies; computerization of system operations is in preparation.},
