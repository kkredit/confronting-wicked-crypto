# The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Is 30 Years Old. It’s More Confusing Than Ever.

- Summary:
  - Overview of the history of the CFAA
  - Written in 2016
- Purpose:
  - Demonstrate that it is ill suited for today's environment
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - The law was passed in 1986
  - It talks about "access" and "authorization" without defining them. This lack of definitions is part of why it is
      interpreted so many ways. (Especially when access is so often through the internet.)
  - Has been at times a damper on security research. We don't want to make security research illegal.
  - Has been used for prosecuting cyberbullying
    - Seems like "this is bad but we're not sure how to prosecute it" + "involves a computer" = "use CFAA"
  - Two camps of interpretation
    - Broad: CFAA applies to use of computers to violate rules, written in code or in written word
    - Narrow: CFAA applies to hacking--rules written in code
      - Otherwise, website owners via the terms of service dictate not the rules for their websites, but _what is legal
          online_
  - Camp 1 was primary for the first 20 years, but things are slowly turning towards camp 2
  - While it has been used too broadly, yet there are still online activities that we would like to prosecute
- Technical comments:
- Notes:

>The very different cases of Drew and Morris illustrate some of the deep confusion and conflicts about the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act, enacted in 1986—at a time when computer networks were largely confined to universities and military
institutions. What that law means today, in a world of ubiquitous smartphones and personal computers where we rely on
the internet for a million routine everyday tasks from chatting with friends to ordering food, is less clear than ever
before....  
It would go on to become one of the most controversial, confusing, and inconsistently interpreted laws in the country.

>Maybe the only thing most people agree on about the CFAA is that it has not noticeably helped protect anyone against
cybercrimes. To some that’s a sign that it’s not punitive and broad enough to catch all the criminals it should. Others
argue it’s instead due to the international nature of online threats, the difficulty of conclusively identifying a
perpetrator, and the way the CFAA deters important lines of security research.
