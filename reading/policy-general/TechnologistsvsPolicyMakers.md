- Summary:
  - Schneier pointing out the differences and arguing for cooperation between technologists and policymakers
- Purpose:
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - One of his big points:
    - "Technologists don’t try to consider all of the use cases of a given technology."...
    - "Policy doesn’t work that way; it’s specifically focused on use. It focuses on people and what they do. Policy
        makers can’t create policy around a piece of technology without understanding how it is used—how all of it’s
        used."
    - This is my point!
