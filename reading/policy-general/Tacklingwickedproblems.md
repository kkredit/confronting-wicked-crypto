# Tackling wicked problems : A public policy perspective

- Summary:
  - An introduction to wicked problems and approaches to addressing them
- Purpose:
  - Australian Public Service Commission article designed to "encourage public service managers to reflect on these
    issues, and to look for ways to improve the capacity of the APS to deal effectively with the complex policy problems
    confronting us."
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - Strategies
    - Options
      - Authoritative
      - Competitive
      - Collaborative
    - Each has their advantages and disadvantages.
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - Outline
    1. Introduction
    2. **Characteristics of wicked problems**
       - difficult to clearly define
       - have many interdependencies and are often multi-causal
       - Attempts to address wicked problems often lead to unforeseen consequences
       - are often not stable
       - usually have no clear solution
       - are socially complex
       - hardly ever sit conveniently within the responsibility of any one organization
       - involve changing behavior
       - are characterized by chronic policy failure
    3. **Possible strategies for tackling wicked problems**
       1. Authoritative - fast and efficient, but may disregard parts of the issue and achieve low buy-in
       2. Competitive - innovative and leads to choice, but can create deadlock and non-solutions
       3. Collaborative - achieves high buy-in and respects the complexity of the issue, but can be costly and difficult
    4. Avoiding a narrow approach
       - Traditional (linear, "tame") problem solving:
         - Understand and define the problem
         - Analyze options; select optimal solution
         - Define outcomes, implementation plans, and performance metrics
         - Execute
       - This fails at each step for wicked problems (see quote below)
       - This often plays out as defining the problem too narrowly, which leads to a tame solution with unintended
         consequences
    5. The need for innovative and flexible approaches
       - Instead of linear problem solving (sec 4), we need adaptive solutions.
       - "Throwing a stone vs throwing a bird"
       - This rebuts "why are we having this discussion again?"
       - This means a solution must be
         - Adaptive--we must expect and plan for the system design to change
         - Fail-safe--when the system changes, we don't want broken assumptions to break everything
         - Iterative
    6. The importance of working across organizational boundaries
    7. Reviewing the accountability framework
    8. Effectively engaging stakeholders and citizens
    9.  The importance of achieving sustained behavioral change
    10. Skills for APS employees
    11. Conclusion

On linear thinking and wicked problems:

> The consensus in the literature, however, is that such a linear, traditional approach to policy formulation is an
> inadequate way to work with wicked policy problems. This is because part of the wickedness of an issue lies in the
> interactions between causal factors, conflicting policy objectives and disagreement over the appropriate solution.
> Linear thinking is inadequate to encompass such interactivity and uncertainty. The shortcomings of a linear approach are
> also due to the social complexity of wicked problems. The fact is that a true understanding of the problem generally
> requires the perspective of multiple organisations and stakeholders, and that any package of measures identified as a
> possible solution usually requires the involvement, commitment and coordination of multiple organisations and
> stakeholders to be delivered effectively.

State— Strategies for Personalising the Public Realm, Demos, London, p. 26. (c.f. chapman_system_2004):

> In these complex circumstances, people and organisations have to become adaptive … public services should be understood
> as complex adaptive systems and not according to the mechanistic models that have traditionally dominated government
> thinking. Paul Plsek likens this difference to that between throwing a stone and throwing a live bird. The trajectory of
> the stone can be calculated precisely using the laws of physics. The trajectory of the bird is far less predictable. The
> question is whether policy-makers can embrace this shift in perspective, and redefine their role as supporters of
> adaptive processes of change. They need to stop pretending they are throwing stones, and acknowledge that the management
> of public services is far more akin to throwing birds.
