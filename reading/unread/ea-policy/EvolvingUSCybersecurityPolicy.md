  abstract = {The connectivity of information systems and networks, and the increasing usage of the
Internet have opened individuals and governments to new types of vulnerabilities necessitating the
rapid development of cybersecurity policy. Defining cybersecurity as the protection of information
systems and networks from misuse, intentional or unintentional harm, or the degradation,
destruction, or denial of services provided through the internet and related to the “Internet of
Things,” this report seeks to address the question of what the US’s cybersecurity policy should
be moving forward. The report seeks to answer this question by addressing the major thematic issues
in US domestic and international cybersecurity policy, and focusing in on five issues that crosscut
domestic and international cybersecurity policy: • There is a lack of trust between citizens,
industry, and government • Cybersecurity legislation is overly broad and ambiguous • There is
lack of cooperation between stakeholders • Policy implementation is weak • Discord amongst
states internationally is hindering the development international cybersecurity norms, despite a
demonstrated desire for such norms This report finds that the United States lacks a robust,
unanimous, and coordinated framework for ensuring the safety of private, governmental, and business
networks. Enhancing and building strong partnerships between industry and government should be a
strategic imperative for all stakeholders. Taking into account the central issues we have
identified, in order for the US to develop robust cybersecurity policy, we recommend the following:
• Standardization o Establish common cyber threat assessment protocols and strong procedural and
legal frameworks utilizing precise language. o Narrow existing, broad policy to foster trust and
engagement between industry, states, and civil groups. • Collaboration o Work closely with
existing international organizations to harmonize and balance international cybersecurity norms. o
Creation of proactive, future oriented legislation by building publicprivate partnerships across
multiple sectors. o Streamline the current governmental accreditation processes for innovative
industry leaders. In this report we will outline existing US cybersecurity policy both domestically
and internationally, identify major stakeholders on all sides of the debate and engage with each
position as it relates to the others, determine gaps in the existing policy, and propose how the US
can fill those gaps to further develop comprehensive and efficient cybersecurity policy. Drawing on
the history of domestic legislation of cyber policy, international agreements, the perspective of
key industry leaders, and the arguments of civil society groups, this report provides a holistic
picture of the field in its present state and what must be improved upon.},
