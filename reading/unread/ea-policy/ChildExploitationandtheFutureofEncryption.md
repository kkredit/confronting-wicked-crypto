  abstract = {On Sept. 28, the New York Times published a harrowing, in-depth investigative story on the prevalence of
child pornography on the internet. The piece describes a staggering increase in the number of reports to the federal
National Center for Missing \& Exploited Children (NCMEC) flagging child sexual abuse imagery online from an
already-high one million in 2014 to an almost unfathomable 18.4 million in 2018â€”an increase of almost 1,750 percent
in just four years.},
