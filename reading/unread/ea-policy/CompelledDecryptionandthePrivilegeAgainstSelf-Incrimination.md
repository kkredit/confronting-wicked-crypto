  abstract = {This Essay considers the Fifth Amendment barrier to orders compelling a suspect to enter in a password to
decrypt a locked phone, computer, or file. It argues that a simple rule should apply: an assertion of privilege should
be sustained unless the government can independently show that the suspect knows the password. The act of entering a
password is testimonial, but the only implied statement is that the suspect knows the password. When the government can
prove this fact independently, the assertion is a foregone conclusion and the Fifth Amendment poses no bar to the
enforcement of the order. This rule is both doctrinally correct and sensible policy. It properly reflects the
distribution of government power in a digital age when nearly everyone is carrying a device that comes with an
extraordinarily powerful lock.},
