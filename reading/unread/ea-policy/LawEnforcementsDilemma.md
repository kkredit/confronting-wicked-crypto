  abstract = {From the thesis abstract: This thesis explores the issue law enforcement has been
confronting since the Edward Snowden leaks prompted technology companies to design their
communication devices with enhanced encryption. As a result of these modifications, many
investigations have been stymied because providers claim that they can no longer furnish law
enforcement with device and communication content, even when so ordered by the court. Device
designers and communication providers claim that enhanced encryption is intended to protect
individual privacy and corporate intellectual property. However, these changes have resulted in
providing criminals and terrorists alike with avenues to communicate anonymously and out of law
enforcement's reach. A significant issue is that legislation has not kept pace with emerging
communication platforms. The Policy Analysis method was employed to explore potential solutions to
this issue, culminating with the conclusion that the problem requires a two-pronged approach to
address both data in motion, and data at rest. Data in motion refers to communications in real
time, and it should be addressed by installing spyware to capture the content. Data at rest refers
to stored content, and it should be addressed by the use of split-key encryption. Both methods
would require amending current statutes or drafting entirely new legislation to cover existing and
future communication platforms.},
