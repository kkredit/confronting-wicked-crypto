  abstract = {We present a general framework for representing cryptographic protocols and analyzing their security. The
framework allows specifying the security requirements of practically any cryptographic task in a unified and systematic
way. Furthermore, in this framework the security of protocols is maintained under a general protocol composition
operation, called universal composition. The proposed framework with its security-preserving composition property allow
for modular design and analysis of complex cryptographic protocols from relatively simple building blocks. Moreover,
within this framework, protocols are guaranteed to maintain their security within any context, even in the presence of
an unbounded number of arbitrary protocol instances that run concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner. This
is a useful guarantee, that allows arguing about the security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable
environments such as modern communication networks.},
