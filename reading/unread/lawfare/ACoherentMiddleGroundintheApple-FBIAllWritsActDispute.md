  abstract = {The very public fight between Apple and the FBI over the last six weeks has not only reinvigorated the
broader debate over the “going dark” concern (and the larger, age-old tension between privacy and security) but has
also drawn attention to the specific legal question of just how much power current federal law (in the form of the All
Writs Act) confers upon judges to compel private persons and companies to take affirmative steps to help the government
execute a duly-issued search warrant.},
