  - Chapter 1
    - The 4thAm is practiced thousands of times every day by police, and has been heard in more than 300 supreme court
        cases since 1953

    >Criminal law can be thought of as being torn between two different sets of goals, what he labeled due process and crime
    control.... When followed faithfully, the demands of due process slow down the criminal process, creating an obstacle
    course of sorts for police and prosecutors, who must take steps to ensure that the individual’s rights are not denied.
    This creates tension with the goal of crime control.... If due process is focused on, then crime control is frustrated.
    If, on the other hand, crime control is given primacy and police are given extensive discretion and tools to
    energetically fight crime, then individual rights are diminished.

    - The "tough on crime" policies beginning with Nixon shifted the focus to crime control, both in regulations and in
        justices appointed to the Court.
    - The Court has issued conflicting 4thAm rulings, though has broadly favored search and seizure powers
    - The Court has long had trouble applying the Constitution to new tech
    - For the first time since the 1970s, the court seems to be in flux again (as of 2015)
    - "The Politics of Crime Control"
      - The Warren court made several rights-protecting decisions in the 1960s (right to a lawyer, Miranda rights)
      - The civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and a general crime wave boosted "tough on crime" sentiments that
          helped propel Nixon into office
      - Nixon appointed 4 justices in his first time! All in line with "a jurisprudence of crime control"
      - Cases in 1983-84 constituted a "jurisprudential regime change" RE the 4thAm
    - "Understanding the Roberts Court and the 4thAm" - a four part argument
      1. "The Roberts Court’s Fourth Amendment case law has been fundamentally shaped by the jurisprudence of crime
          control."
        - "liberal" in the context of the 4thAm typically means siding with the individual; "conservative" is siding
            with the state. This is an instance of the terms that highlight their inconsistent values (don't
            conservatives place more importance on individual freedom and responsibility?)
      2. "Many of the prodefendant decisions that the Court issues can best be understood as minor corrections within
          the dominant paradigm of crime control."

      >We can think of the Court providing a check and balance on its own crime control regime, and in the process enhancing
      the legitimacy of the underlying regime by creating the appearance of judicial neutrality.

      3. "One must pay attention to the small-group dynamics of the Court to understand its decisional output" (court
          composition)
        - Addition of Sotomayor and Kagan, and liberalization (via originalism) of Scalia on 4thAm cases
        - Good definition of originalism. "Critics of originalism... have suggested that it is a smoke screen for
            justices to simply achieve the policy outcome they want."
      1. "Cases in which digital privacy rights are at stake are handled by the Court differently than other types of
          Fourth Amendment cases."

      >We argue that cases involving privacy and information technology generate public attention in such a way that the Court
      is attuned to the fact that its decision will have wide ramifications, and the justices are increasingly cognizant of
      the unique nature of the privacy interests raised by these facts.

      >These cases were quite salient, much more so than the run-of-the-mill search and seizure case. Both cases resulted in
      major newspaper editorials, before and after the Court’s decisions.18 Fourth Amendment issues intersecting privacy and
      technology might very well represent issues where the Court is forced to revisit the broader privacy concerns that have
      been largely ignored in the past 30 years.

- Outline of the rest of the book:

>This book is in two parts. Part 1 provides the historical foundation for the Roberts Court.
2. Chapter 2 sketches the early history of the Fourth Amendment, explains the major decisions of the Warren Court, and
provides context for the political backlash that it unleashed.
3. Chapter 3 describes the Burger Court’s transformation, demonstrating how the Court redefined Fourth Amendment
analysis, placed limits on the exclusionary rule, stunted the development of the reasonable expectation of privacy
jurisprudence, and resulted in a regime shift that established a jurisprudence of crime control.
4. Chapter 4 focuses on how the Rehnquist Court refined the crime control philosophy, paying particular attention to how
Court decisions served to enable the politics of crime control, as it matured in the 1980s and 1990s into an all-out war
on drugs.
Part 2 offers an in-depth examination of the evolution of the Fourth Amendment on the Roberts Court.
5. Chapter 5 provides a broad overview of the Roberts Court, and illustrates how the Fourth Amendment is in flux. We
return to the technology cases in greater detail, and explore the changing role of Justice Scalia.
6. Chapter 6 considers how the jurisprudence of crime control is alive and well on the Roberts Court. We consider the
exigent circumstances exception, as well as the Court’s further limiting of the exclusionary rule, and illustrate how
the Court relies on the jurisprudence of crime control in many of its cases.
7. Chapter 7 uses Arizona v. Gant as the centerpiece of an examination of how the Roberts Court has treated some of the
excesses of crime control, and considers how the Roberts Court has decided cases that have provided a check and balance
on the criminal justice system, while still remaining faithful to the primary jurisprudence of crime control.
8. The book concludes in chapter 8 by summarizing the argument and suggesting some of the hard issues that the Court is
likely to face in future years. We make the case for unshackling the Fourth Amendment from the jurisprudence of crime
control. We will argue that while the jurisprudence of crime control explains how the Fourth Amendment has evolved, it
does not have to dictate its future. Technology cases are creating a tension on the Court that could potentially result
in a reevaluation of the meaning of Fourth Amendment privacy and new protections for the digital privacy rights of
Americans.

- Outline continued
  - Chapter 5
    - The jurisprudence of crime control was still the default during the first several years of the Roberts court
    - Beginning in roughly 2012 and 2013 (first term after Snowden leaks...), cases began shifting from ~75% in favor of
        the state to ~50% in favor of the state
    - Two landmark cases involved privacy and digital technology, and sided with the plaintiff with 9/9 justices
      - _United States v. Jones_ (2012) "held that police needed a warrant prior to installing a GPS tracking device to
          conduct surveillance of a vehicle"
      - _Riley v. California_ (2014) held that "police needed a warrant to search the content of a smartphone seized
          incident to arrest"
    - Scalia around this time changed his voting trend as well:

    >How do we explain the shift of Justice Scalia? His decision in United States v. Jones is instructive. Scalia chose not
    to use the Katz reasonable expectation of privacy standard, and instead based his argument on the older and largely
    discredited trespass doctrine. Scalia had long been a proponent of originalism as a method of constitutional
    interpretation. For an originalist, the intentions of those who authored the text are paramount, especially when the
    text is unclear or admits of multiple interpretations. Many of Scalia’s Fourth Amendment opinions make reference to the
    views of the Framers of the Constitution and the historical context of the Fourth Amendment when it was first ratified.
    Yet, before his opinion in Jones, originalism only seemed to play a minor role in most of his search and seizure
    opinions. His opinions were normally driven by extensive reference to the precedents that the Court had developed in the
    prior 40 years. He might not have liked the Katz precedent, but he still used it. In Jones, however, he chose to
    resurrect the trespass doctrine, ignoring that it had been explicitly overruled by the Court in Katz. The dramatic
    change in approach in Jones may have very well marked a turning point in his approach to the Fourth Amendment.

    - On technology:

    >In the past several years, the Court has been forced to consider a pair of decisions involving the application of
    information technology to law enforcement’s efforts to fight crime. These cases resonate deeply with the American
    public, and have injected questions about the approach the Court has taken in Fourth Amendment cases since the 1980s.
    The decisions in United States v. Jones and Riley v. California illustrate not only how the Court is changing, but more
    importantly, raise questions for the future.

    - "_United States v. Jones_ and Warrantless GPS Surveillance"
      - Good history of surveillance and law enforcement. Maybe I will have to flip through chapters 2 and 3.

      >Compared with most criminal justice cases, the GPS case was highly salient. Even though the use of GPS was to combat
      crime and fight the war on drugs, something about the issue resonated with people.

      - This section has excellent content for an arg-map on what constitutes a search
      - HOWEVER: this is all hand-wringing over when a warrant is required. This does not touch the question of what to
          do when a warrant is provided. Even most EA proponents say "with use of a warrant."

    - "_Riley v. California_: A Sweeping Endorsement of Digital Privacy"
      - Instead of relying on previous precedents in deciding this case of phone search incident to arrest, Chief
          Justice Roberts "wrote an opinion that can only be described as a sweeping endorsement of digital privacy"
      - "Roberts went so far as to suggest, 'A cell phone search would typically expose to the government far more than
          the most exhaustive search of a house.'"
      - The Justices are stressing that they're not completely unaware of the evolving technical landscape:

      >The justices were very leery of the way a pro– crime control decision would be viewed, and several justices went out of
      their way to try to show their familiarity with smartphones and the use of “cloud” storage for personal information....
      Roberts’ opinion sought to make his knowledge of contemporary technology clear, even going so far as to referencing the
      Apple iPhone user manual.

      - The endorsement of privacy did not broach the 3rd party doctrine:

      >His opinion did not overrule the third party doctrine, however, as he distinguished a cell phone search from that of a
      pen register, which merely collects a list of numbers called and received. Yet, the broad opinion in Riley leaves the
      door open for Sotomayor’s criticism of the third party doctrine to be revisited.

  - Chapter 8
    - Looking to the future, several factors could influence the direction this goes
      - Makeup of the court
        - Since this was written, Kennedy retired and Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have joined
        - TODO: look at 4thAm cases since they've joined!
      - Public feelings about privacy
      - Public feelings about policing in general (especially given the protesting in 2020)

    >The underlying motivations of law enforcement are not seen as relevant to Fourth Amendment issues, as long as there is
    some objective measure of probable cause present for the most minor of offenses. A long train of cases has made it such
    that the warrant exception has become the rule as opposed to the rare occurrence. This has fed into the vast expansion
    of police power and the belief that combatting crime control is far more important than protecting individual rights.  
    The criticism and backlash against police that have arisen in the past few years are different in many ways from what
    happened in the 1960s. Then, the Court was blamed for coddling criminals, and it was the focal point of criticism over
    both the rights of the accused and civil rights issues. Today, criticisms of excessive police use of force are focused
    on the police, with few commentators making a link between the decisions of the Supreme Court and the behavior of the
    police. While criticisms of mass incarceration and the racial disparity evident in the war on drugs have begun to raise
    questions about the fairness of the criminal justice system, the Court has managed to stay on the periphery of them. As
    a result, there has been no public push demanding change by the Supreme Court to its criminal procedure jurisprudence.
    This does not mean that the Court is not aware of the broader political issues surrounding its actions, but the degree
    to which the justices take them into account when deciding cases is uncertain.

    - "coming cases: cell phone tracking and the third party doctrine"
      - Quote: When a cell phone tracking case does come to the Court, there will be two main issues:
        - (1) the validity of the third party doctrine; and
        - (2) the strength of the right to privacy with regard to one’s location.

  abstract = {"When the Founders penned the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, it was not difficult to identify the
"persons, houses, papers, and effects" they meant to protect; nor was it hard to understand what "unreasonable searches
and seizures" were. The Fourth Amendment was intended to stop the use of general warrants and writs of assistance and
applied primarily to protect the home. Flash forward to a time of digital devices, automobiles, the war on drugs, and a
Supreme Court dominated by several decades of the jurisprudence of crime control, and the legal meaning of everything
from "effects" to "seizures" has dramatically changed. Michael C. Gizzi and R. Craig Curtis make sense of these changes
in The Fourth Amendment in Flux. The book traces the development and application of search and seizure law and
jurisprudence over time, with particular emphasis on decisions of the Roberts Court. Cell phones, GPS tracking devices,
drones, wiretaps, the Patriot Act, constantly changing technology, and a political culture that emphasizes crime
control create new challenges for Fourth Amendment interpretation and jurisprudence. This work exposes the tensions
caused by attempts to apply pretechnological legal doctrine to modern problems of digital privacy. In their analysis of
the Roberts Court's relevant decisions, Gizzi and Curtis document the different approaches to the law that have been
applied by the justices since the Obama nominees took their seats on the court. Their account, combining law, political
science, and history, provides insight into the court's small group dynamics, and traces changes regarding search and
seizure law in the opinions of one of its longest serving members, Justice Antonin Scalia. At a time when issues of
privacy are increasingly complicated by technological advances, this overview and analysis of Fourth Amendment law is
especially welcome--an invaluable resource as we address the enduring question of how to balance freedom against
security in the context of the challenges of the twenty-first century"--},
