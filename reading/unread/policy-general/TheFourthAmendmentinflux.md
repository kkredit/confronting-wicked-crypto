- Outline
  - Chapter 1
    - The 4thAm is practiced thousands of times every day by police, and has been heard in more than 300 supreme court
        cases since 1953

>Criminal law can be thought of as being torn between two different sets of goals, what he labeled due process and crime
control.... When followed faithfully, the demands of due process slow down the criminal process, creating an obstacle
course of sorts for police and prosecutors, who must take steps to ensure that the individual’s rights are not denied.
This creates tension with the goal of crime control.... If due process is focused on, then crime control is frustrated.
If, on the other hand, crime control is given primacy and police are given extensive discretion and tools to
energetically fight crime, then individual rights are diminished.

    - The "tough on crime" policies beginning with Nixon shifted the focus to crime control, both in regulations and in
        justices appointed to the Court.
    - The Court has issued conflicting 4thAm rulings, though has broadly favored search and seizure powers
    - The Court has long had trouble applying the Constitution to new tech
    - For the first time since the 1970s, the court seems to be in flux again (as of 2015)
    - "The Politics of Crime Control"
      - The Warren court made several rights-protecting decisions in the 1960s (right to a lawyer, Miranda rights)
      - The civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and a general crime wave boosted "tough on crime" sentiments that
          helped propel Nixon into office
      - Nixon appointed 4 justices in his first time! All in line with "a jurisprudence of crime control"
      - Cases in 1983-84 constituted a "jurisprudential regime change" RE the 4thAm
    - "Understanding the Roberts Court and the 4thAm" - a four part argument
      1. "The Roberts Court’s Fourth Amendment case law has been fundamentally shaped by the jurisprudence of crime
          control."
        - "liberal" in the context of the 4thAm typically means siding with the individual; "conservative" is siding
            with the state. This is an instance of the terms that highlight their inconsistent values (don't
            conservatives place more importance on individual freedom and responsibility?)
      2. "Many of the prodefendant decisions that the Court issues can best be understood as minor corrections within
          the dominant paradigm of crime control."

>We can think of the Court providing a check and balance on its own crime control regime, and in the process enhancing
the legitimacy of the underlying regime by creating the appearance of judicial neutrality.

      3. "One must pay attention to the small-group dynamics of the Court to understand its decisional output" (court
          composition)
        - Addition of Sotomayor and Kagan, and liberalization (via originalism) of Scalia on 4thAm cases
        - Good definition of originalism. "Critics of originalism... have suggested that it is a smoke screen for
            justices to simply achieve the policy outcome they want."
      1. "Cases in which digital privacy rights are at stake are handled by the Court differently than other types of
          Fourth Amendment cases."

>We argue that cases involving privacy and information technology generate public attention in such a way that the Court
is attuned to the fact that its decision will have wide ramifications, and the justices are increasingly cognizant of
the unique nature of the privacy interests raised by these facts.

>These cases were quite salient, much more so than the run-of-the-mill search and seizure case. Both cases resulted in
major newspaper editorials, before and after the Court’s decisions.18 Fourth Amendment issues intersecting privacy and
technology might very well represent issues where the Court is forced to revisit the broader privacy concerns that have
been largely ignored in the past 30 years.

- Outline of the rest of the book:

>This book is in two parts. Part 1 provides the historical foundation for the Roberts Court.
2. Chapter 2 sketches the early history of the Fourth Amendment, explains the major decisions of the Warren Court, and
provides context for the political backlash that it unleashed.
3. Chapter 3 describes the Burger Court’s transformation, demonstrating how the Court redefined Fourth Amendment
analysis, placed limits on the exclusionary rule, stunted the development of the reasonable expectation of privacy
jurisprudence, and resulted in a regime shift that established a jurisprudence of crime control.
4. Chapter 4 focuses on how the Rehnquist Court refined the crime control philosophy, paying particular attention to how
Court decisions served to enable the politics of crime control, as it matured in the 1980s and 1990s into an all-out war
on drugs.
Part 2 offers an in-depth examination of the evolution of the Fourth Amendment on the Roberts Court.
5. Chapter 5 provides a broad overview of the Roberts Court, and illustrates how the Fourth Amendment is in flux. We
return to the technology cases in greater detail, and explore the changing role of Justice Scalia.
6. Chapter 6 considers how the jurisprudence of crime control is alive and well on the Roberts Court. We consider the
exigent circumstances exception, as well as the Court’s further limiting of the exclusionary rule, and illustrate how
the Court relies on the jurisprudence of crime control in many of its cases.
7. Chapter 7 uses Arizona v. Gant as the centerpiece of an examination of how the Roberts Court has treated some of the
excesses of crime control, and considers how the Roberts Court has decided cases that have provided a check and balance
on the criminal justice system, while still remaining faithful to the primary jurisprudence of crime control.
8. The book concludes in chapter 8 by summarizing the argument and suggesting some of the hard issues that the Court is
likely to face in future years. We make the case for unshackling the Fourth Amendment from the jurisprudence of crime
control. We will argue that while the jurisprudence of crime control explains how the Fourth Amendment has evolved, it
does not have to dictate its future. Technology cases are creating a tension on the Court that could potentially result
in a reevaluation of the meaning of Fourth Amendment privacy and new protections for the digital privacy rights of
Americans.

  abstract = {"When the Founders penned the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, it was not difficult to identify the
"persons, houses, papers, and effects" they meant to protect; nor was it hard to understand what "unreasonable searches
and seizures" were. The Fourth Amendment was intended to stop the use of general warrants and writs of assistance and
applied primarily to protect the home. Flash forward to a time of digital devices, automobiles, the war on drugs, and a
Supreme Court dominated by several decades of the jurisprudence of crime control, and the legal meaning of everything
from "effects" to "seizures" has dramatically changed. Michael C. Gizzi and R. Craig Curtis make sense of these changes
in The Fourth Amendment in Flux. The book traces the development and application of search and seizure law and
jurisprudence over time, with particular emphasis on decisions of the Roberts Court. Cell phones, GPS tracking devices,
drones, wiretaps, the Patriot Act, constantly changing technology, and a political culture that emphasizes crime
control create new challenges for Fourth Amendment interpretation and jurisprudence. This work exposes the tensions
caused by attempts to apply pretechnological legal doctrine to modern problems of digital privacy. In their analysis of
the Roberts Court's relevant decisions, Gizzi and Curtis document the different approaches to the law that have been
applied by the justices since the Obama nominees took their seats on the court. Their account, combining law, political
science, and history, provides insight into the court's small group dynamics, and traces changes regarding search and
seizure law in the opinions of one of its longest serving members, Justice Antonin Scalia. At a time when issues of
privacy are increasingly complicated by technological advances, this overview and analysis of Fourth Amendment law is
especially welcome--an invaluable resource as we address the enduring question of how to balance freedom against
security in the context of the challenges of the twenty-first century"--},
