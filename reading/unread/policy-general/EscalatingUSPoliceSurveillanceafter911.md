  abstract = {In recent years U.S. police have been given greater surveillance powers in response to perceived threats
from crime, drugs, and terrorism. Several legal and criminal events have facilitated a reevaluation of the balance
between police surveillance authority and civil privacy protection. In the post-9/11 era, changes in federal law, court
interpretation of privacy safeguards, and technological advances have expanded the circumstances and methods by which
the police may engage in surveillance of civil activities. This paper examines the factors contributing to the
escalation in police surveillance and its effects on privacy rights and civil life. The analysis suggests that
increasing police surveillance has diminished individual privacy protections and impacted aspects of civil life.},
