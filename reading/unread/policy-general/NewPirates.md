  abstract = {Various authors on cybersecurity have compared cyberspace to the high seas and
suggested that states should contract privateers, in the form of private corporations or
individuals, in order to bolster their defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace. This
conceptual paper explores the high seas-cyberspace analogy and evaluates the extent to which it can
strategically inform the battle against cybercrime. It is argued that the historical battle against
piracy, characterized by its emphasis on legal frameworks, the removal of market support
structures, and states’ use of privateers, offers limited lessons with regard to cybercrime. The
analogy suggests that strategies against cybercrime should stress the usefulness of existing legal
structures and earmark additional resources for them, while also prioritizing the establishing of
specialized cybercrime courts and the hiring of former cybercriminals. Moreover, the comparison
between piracy and cybercrime suggests that cybercrime should be treated as a socio-economic
problem, while the historical use of privateers can be reimagined as cyber-privateering to
potentially construct a new model of cyberdeterrence.},
