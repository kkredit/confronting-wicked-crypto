  abstract = {Taking Rights Seriously
              is concerned above all with due process, both in law and politics. In this respect, his theory of law and
critique of legal positivism frames his theory of politics. He conceives both law and politics in terms of a “right
to equality,” the aim being to show individuals equal concern and respect. However, whereas he regards legal process
as a matter of principle, orientated toward viewing our relations with others in terms of justice, he treats political
process as dealing only with policy and focused on promoting the general welfare. The result is an account of law and
politics that is original yet idiosyncratic. Though he sees rights-based judicial review as legitimately trumping
utilitarian democratic decisions, his account of legal deliberation is in its way democratic, as his view of civil
disobedience illustrates, and could apply as much—if not more—to legislatures as to courts.},
