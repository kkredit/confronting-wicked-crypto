  abstract = {Many of the most pressing policy challenges for the APS involve dealing with very complex problems. These
problems share a range of characteristics—they go beyond the capacity of any one organisation to understand and
respond to, and there is often disagreement about the causes of the problems and the best way to tackle them. These
complex policy problems are sometimes called ‘wicked’ problems.},
