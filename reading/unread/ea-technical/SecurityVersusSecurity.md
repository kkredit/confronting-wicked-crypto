  abstract = {This paper analyzes the current debate over encryption policy. Through careful
evaluation of possible solutions to ‘going dark’ as well has weighting the costsand benefits of
each solution, we found exceptional access to information more harmful than helpful. Today, there
seems to be no singular leading answer to the going dark problem. Exceptional access to data and
communications is a simple solution for a simple problem, however going dark is very complex, and
requires a multifaceted and refined solutions. Widespread encryption forces those
listening—whether it is the NSA, FBI, foreign governments, criminals or terrorist—to be much
more targeted. As for the going dark metaphor, it seems as though we are not entirely “going
dark”, and yet we are not completely bright either. There are dark and bright spots coming and
going across the technological landscape battling in a perpetual technological arms race. The
findings of this paper, ultimately determine there to be no policy that doesn’t come without some
cost. That said, there are a number of ways in which law enforcement can track criminals and
terrorist without weakening encryption, which we determine to be the best direction in any win lose
situation. Nevertheless, as technology continues to evolve and encryption capabilities continue to
become a part of everyday life for Americans this debate will only grow larger, and we, as a
society, must determine how tomake the best of it.},
