  abstract = {For years, legal wiretapping was straightforward:  the officer doing the intercept connected a tape
recorder or the like to a single pair of wires. By the 1990s, though, the changing structure of telecommunications —
there was no longer just “Ma Bell” to talk to — and new technologies such as ISDN and cellular telephony made
executing a wiretap more complicated for law enforcement. Simple technologies would no longer suffice. In response,
Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which mandated a standardized lawful
intercept  interface on all local phone switches. Technology has continued to progress, and in the face of new forms of
communication — Skype, voice chat during multi-player online games, many forms of instant messaging, etc.— law
enforcement is again experiencing problems. The FBI has called  this “Going Dark”:  their loss of access to
suspects’ communication. According to news reports, they want changes to the wiretap laws to require a CALEA-­like
interface in Internet software.},
