  abstract = {This thesis examines the ongoing debate between law enforcement and the intelligence
communities on one side, and the technology industry and privacy rights groups on the other, over
the going dark problem. Going dark is a phenomenon created by ubiquitous use of end-to-end
encryption over communication devices and Internet platforms, rendering those communications
warrant-proof. End-to-end encryption means that only the sender and receiver of the message can
read it, and no one in between. Even with a properly executed warrant or subpoena, law enforcement
and intelligence agencies are unable to access the data they need because that data was encrypted.
This thesis explores the historical, political and legislative developments that contributed to the
rise of encryption in recent years, as well as constitutional doctrines that may be relevant to the
public debate over possible policy solutions. Through the policy options analysis method, this
thesis identifies lawful hacking as a middle-ground solution that policymakers should adopt in the
short term. It also recommends that the U.S. government initiate a public education campaign to
gain public support for some form of regulation concerning encryption in the future. The
fundamental issue here is not only about the tension between privacy and security. The issue is
also about who should make decisions with broad implications for the collective security: elected
officials or the technology industry.},
