# Encryption and Combating Child Exploitation Imagery

- Summary:
  - EA will not help stop CP; stopping CP may require detection on devices
- Purpose:
  - Expose flaw in LE/Gov argument
  - Propose alternative
- Premises:
- Contributions:
  - Proposal for CP detection: scan on devices
    - Use something like [PhotoDNA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/PhotoDNA/#)
    - Performs photo fingerprinting on device
    - Seems easy to evade, but makes the job harder
    - "everyone’s phone and computer would check to see if the machine contained known child-abuse
        images"
      - This sounds worse to me. This is not exceptional, it is mass. And when the framework is in
          place, it will be trivial to tack on other checks.
- Policy comments:
  - E2E will harm CP detection
  - EA will _not_ help with CP _detection_
  - The author overlooks that it is needed for CP _conviction_ for website maintainers
    - This also is a different problem; that is for decrypting hard drivers, usually, and those
        running these types of websites can and will evade even EA built into hard disks by
        encrypting in SW before writing to disk...
    - And do we win the war on drugs by going after the suppliers? No...
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - "Child exploitation images are a horrific problem... The larger computer security community,
      however, often seems to take a bit of a glib attitude toward the issue."
  - "The current systems for detecting these images rely on bulk surveillance by private companies,
      and even the most cursory encryption—with “exceptional access” or no—will eliminate this
      surveillance."
  - "Although the problem is horrific, proposals to weaken encryption often use child exploitation
      images as an excuse in ways that don’t meaningfully address the problem."
