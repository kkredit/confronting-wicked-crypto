# A Roadmap for Exceptional Access Research

- Summary:
  - Excellent survey of the debate, technical considerations, and ideas for steps forward
  - Basically an essay version of my thesis
- Purpose:
  - Break the logjam a little
  - Provide an insight to the debate and resources for those interested
- Premises:
  - The debate raging so far is a political battle, and is increasingly polarized
  - Our common goal is public safety
- Contributions:
  - A level head
- Policy comments:
  - "Reviving technological research into EA is essential to improve the state of the policy debate"
  - Classes of concern:
    - Public safety and national security
      - Con: decreased info security
      - Pro: solve more crimes
    - Democratic values
      - Con: privacy is important
      - Pro: LE norms have evolved over centuries; many people want LEAs to have access
    - International ramifications
      - Con: market imbalances; potential for abuse by oppressive governments
      - Pro: a well-designed EA system will improve the security for those with access requirements
        - (more than 50% of the population as of 2018)
    - Alternatives
      - Con: the determined will find a way to strongly encrypt
      - Pro: LEA alternative is lawful hacking, which has its own problems
- Technical comments:
- Notes:

Yes.
>These crypto wars have been fought over the past several decades as a political battle. Even though
all parties have the common goal of improving public safety, they enter the fray with differing
personal and professional biases, which cause them to prioritize either improving digital security
to prevent crime or providing tools for law enforcement to investigate crimes with a digital
component. Predictably, this politicization has led to dour consequences. Views become polarized
into an “us vs. them” mentality, with technologists and government officials both claiming the
imperative to act as strongly as the law permits and abhorring any “middle ground.” Illogical
arguments promulgate, such as the focus of EA proponents’ on terrorism even though EA is more likely
to aid in the investigation of ordinary criminal activity, and the focus of EA opponents on past
mistakes that bear no relation to modern proposals. Finally, participants tend to use provocative,
alienating rhetoric like “responsible encryption” or “backdoors.”

>Reviving technological research into EA is essential to improve the state of the policy debate. In
the short term, this would provide time and space for technologists to improve upon the state of the
art in exceptional access: the reality today is that all existing EA proposals have been
insufficiently vetted and, if deployed, would pose systemic risk to the digital ecosystem. More
research and engagement between law enforcement and the technical community could change that—but
this cannot happen when these groups are pitted against each other in a political debate. In the
longer term, developing a variety of modern EA proposals would crystallize and refocus a policy
debate currently lacking in technical specifics.

>Perhaps the most important action that can be taken to advance the policy debate is to acknowledge
the good faith and common interests of everyone involved. As the Encryption Working Group within the
House Judiciary and Energy & Commerce Committees astutely observes, it is simultaneously true that:
"The widespread adoption of encryption poses a real challenge to the law enforcement community and
strong encryption is essential to both individual privacy and national security. A narrative that
sets government agencies against private industry, or security interests against individual privacy,
does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue."
