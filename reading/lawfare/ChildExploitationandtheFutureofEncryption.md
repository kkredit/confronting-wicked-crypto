  - The sheer volume of CSAM abuse, facilitated by encryption, is turning CP from a bogeyman to a real danger
  - This is also at play in the battle against misinformation (see scott_why_2019)
  - **Trend**
    - This is more about the majority of low level cases than the few high profile cases. Serious terrorists, drug
        lords, and pedophiles will use freely available encryption tools that will be nearly impossible to stamp out.
    - For them: real investigation, and _maybe_ lawful hacking. They tend to mess up their op-sec at some point.
    - For the rest: making criminal activity riskier and enforcement a little easier can go a long way.
  - Absolutist strategies, such as supported by the EFF, will be increasingly out of touch
- Technical comments:
- Notes:

>Regardless of the overall challenges, the shift of the encryption debate promises one positive change: greater
recognition of the reality of encryption’s role in facilitating child exploitation will put to rest tired arguments that
the security and privacy benefits of encryption so vastly outweigh the costs that its broad use should go unquestioned.

>What seems clear is that, even within the technology community, ubiquitous encryption that defeats government and
technology companies alike may no longer be a straightforward issue with an obvious answer. Those who pretend otherwise
will get left behind in the coming debate.

National Center for Missing \& Exploited Children (NCMEC) flagging child sexual abuse imagery online from an
already-high one million in 2014 to an almost unfathomable 18.4 million in 2018—an increase of almost 1,750 percent
