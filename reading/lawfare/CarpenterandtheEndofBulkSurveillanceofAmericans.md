# Carpenter and the End of Bulk Surveillance of Americans

- Summary:
  - The _Carpenter_ ruling has limited the import of the 3rd party doctrine! It was however, narrow, and does not
      provide a new guideline on how 4thAm and the 3rd party doctrine will be enforced.
  - The ruling also blurs the lines about metadata. The case was about cell site location information (CSLI), which is
      technically metadata, which has historically been considered fair game.

>The Carpenter decision does not provide a clear legal standard for when the Fourth Amendment applies to data shared
with a third party, and it raises many questions about the future of Fourth Amendment doctrine. But the decision does
offer a resounding declaration that Fourth Amendment analysis must take account of the “seismic shifts in digital
technology” and the power of modern surveillance tools. In particular, the Carpenter decision should foreclose, once and
for all, any claim that bulk surveillance of Americans—or bulk collection of their digital records—would be
constitutional.

momentous Fourth Amendment decision “a narrow one.” The specific holding—that a warrant is required for law
enforcement to access historical cell site location information (CSLI)—may indeed be narrow, and the decision
rightfully cautions that “the Court must tread carefully” when considering new technologies.},
