# What if Responsible Encryption Back-Doors Were Possible?

- Summary:
  - Even if EA is possible, it should not be done out of defense of individual rights
- Purpose:
  - Analyze the "should we" question
- Premises:
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - "The security interests of technology vendors and their customers are generally aligned... There
      are cases where vendors fail to adequately protect their customers and suffer consequences in
      the marketplace... a rational consumer will select a vendor that provides better security."
    - This is based in nice theory, but cost and speed to market are 1000x more important to
        companies and consumers than security.
    - There are many ideas like this
- Technical comments:
- Notes:
  - "One of the fundamental constitutional precepts that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized is
      the presumption of privacy."
    - He goes on in some detail about what is allowed, going as far as "encryption products may be
        sold that protect the privacy of data without restriction". This wasn't true before the late
        90s.
    - Question: precisely how strong is the legal precedent for "the presumption of privacy"?
  - "Under exceptional circumstances and with appropriate judicial review, law enforcement may be
      permitted to attempt to violate my privacy. But a search warrant is so-named because it grants
      a right to searchâ€”not a guarantee to find."

- Objections cited
  - Complexity is enemy of security
  - Misaligns interests of vendors and customers
  - Increases cost
  - Decreases security
  - Must be mandated; would make US products less competitive
  - Is evadable using well known ciphers
  - There are alternatives
    - Keyloggers (hack back)
    - Break into phones (hack back)
  - Will slip into mass surveillance
