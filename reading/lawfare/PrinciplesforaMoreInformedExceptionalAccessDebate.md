# Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate

- Summary:
  - Provide some talking points to enable deeper conversation around EA
  - A little optimistic about how helpful this will be
    - "I know what the problem is, lack of detail. Solved." (not a quote; the gist)
  - Authors are UK GCHQ intelligence and security technical directors
  - Responded to in franklin_open_2019
- Purpose:
- Premises:
  - Focused on "mass-scale, commodity, end-to-end encrypted services, which today pose one of the
      toughest challenges for targeted lawful access to data and an apparent dichotomy around
      security"
- Contributions:
- Policy comments:
  - "The U.K. government strongly supports commodity encryption."
  - They admit the need for Gov'ts and LEAs to be clearer about what they want
  - "We don’t think vendors should knowingly remove access to data or capabilities that are useful
      to public protection agencies, where there’s no real customer benefit."
    - They're putting a pretty heavy discount on basic privacy
  - They are in favor of some sort of public auditing for assurance the system is being used
      properly
- Technical comments:
  - "Much of the public narrative on this topic talks about security as a binary property; something
      is either secure or it’s not. This isn’t true—every real system is a set of design
      trade-offs."
    - True
  - Suggestions:
    - E2E
      - "Conference call" LEAs in
      - "We’re **not** talking about weakening encryption or defeating the end-to-end nature of the
          service. In a solution like this, we’re normally talking about suppressing a notification
          on a target’s device, and only on the device of the target and possibly those they
          communicate with."
      - Not weakening encryption, but suppressing notifications and adding silent listeners. This
          _requires_ participation of the service provider, which is possibly since they said they
          are focusing on "mass-scale, commodity, end-to-end encrypted services"
    - Device
      - Discuss HW alterations, forced SW updates
- Notes:

Principles:

1. Privacy and security protections are critical to public confidence. Therefore, we will only seek
exceptional access to data where there’s a legitimate need, that access is the least intrusive way
of proceeding and there is appropriate legal authorisation.
2. Investigative tradecraft has to evolve with technology.
3. Even when we have a legitimate need, we can’t expect 100 percent access 100 percent of the time.
4. Targeted exceptional access capabilities should not give governments unfettered access to user
data.
5. Any exceptional access solution should not fundamentally change the trust relationship between a
service provider and its users.
6. Transparency is essential.

>We also need to be very careful not to take any component or proposal and claim that it proves that
the problem is either totally solved or totally insoluble.
