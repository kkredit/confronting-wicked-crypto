# To-do list to complete this thesis

## By final submission (Dec. 19)

- Address TODO:s and FIXME:s
- Proof read for errors
- Proof read for style
- Edit: "You're finished not when there's nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"

## If return and publish later

- Follow up on current items
  - Pandemic
  - Bills that are active, but will expire
- Consider changing "exceptional access" term to "lawful access" (amend threat model intro if so)
- Maybe remove international policy comments. Some may be wrong, and it's not a real area of expertise or added value.
- Dulimarta's research idea:
  - Assign strength values to the argument nodes and relations and perform quantitative ("fuzzy logic") analysis on them
  - My thoughts: would be interesting, but assigning values would be hard, and you would inevitably end with strong,
    valid arguments that come to different conclusions simply due to conflicting underlying values
  - Could be a good way to weed out bad arguments.
