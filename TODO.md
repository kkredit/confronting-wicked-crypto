# To-do list to complete this thesis

## Publishing

### Notes from previous discussions

- Publishing
  - He tends to favor journals over conferences
  - GVSU does pay for open access publication fees (<$3000)
  - Journal choice
    - ACM, IEEE probably fine (IEEE, not always)
    - USENIX probably fine if applicable
    - IARIA has low-standards
- Spinoffs
  - Short paper on diagramming method of cryptography (Kalafut)?
  - Short overview for the Applied Computing Institute blog (Engelsma)? (would link to full thesis)
  - Adapting for 290 class (Leidig)?

### Edits to make

- Follow up on current items
  - Pandemic
  - Bills that are active, but will expire
- Consider changing "exceptional access" term to "lawful access" (amend threat model intro if so)
- Maybe remove international policy comments. Some may be wrong, and it's not a real area of expertise or added value.
- Dulimarta's research idea:
  - Assign strength values to the argument nodes and relations and perform quantitative ("fuzzy logic") analysis on them
  - My thoughts: would be interesting, but assigning values would be hard, and you would inevitably end with strong,
    valid arguments that come to different conclusions simply due to conflicting underlying values
  - Could be a good way to weed out bad arguments.

### Targets

The thesis is far too long to publish in its entirety anywhere. I need to identify publishable portions.

- IEEE author resource center: [link](https://newauthors.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/)

- Arguments for and against EA (primarily Chapter 5)
  - IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society
    [link](https://technologyandsociety.org/transactions/tts-author-information/)
    - **Next deadline: UNKNOWN**
    - Great fit thematically. Kalafut thinks they may stress empirical research, which is not what I have. With the
      diagrams, the 10 page limit would be tough. (I think I could ditch the later two diagrams, which are too
      comprehensive to be very helpful.)
  - Magazines (as backup?)
    - IEEE Security and Privacy magazine [link](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/write-for-us/14680)
      - [CFPs](https://www.computer.org/publications/author-resources/calls-for-papers)
      - [Cipher(?) CFPs](https://www.ieee-security.org/CFP/Cipher-Call-for-Papers.html)
      - **Next deadline: UNKNOWN**
    - IEEE Technology and Society magazine
      [link](https://technologyandsociety.org/technology-and-society-magazine/information-for-authors/)
      - **Next deadline: UNKNOWN**
- Diagramming and threat model (part of Chapter 4, primarily Chapter 6)
  - ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security [link](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tops/author-guidelines)
    - **Next deadline: UNKNOWN**
  - Kalafut:  The community needs followup/analysis of major proposals, and I think reviewers will recognize the value
    in this. Data flow diagram work seems to mainly be published in software engineering journals. I think it is
    publishable on its own. However, I think it will be easier to integrate it with the EA/LDAWMSR paper (and since TOPS
    gives 35 pages, I think there is enough space).
- Wicked Problems (primarily Chapter 3)
  - Policy Studies Journal [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15410072)
    - My idea. Would I get laughed out of the "room"? Really not my specialty. Lowest priority.
