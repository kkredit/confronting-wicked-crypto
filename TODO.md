## By final submission (Dec. 19)

- Address TODO:s and FIXME:s
- Proof read for errors
- Proof read for style
- Edit: 'when there is nothing left to take away'...

## Status meeting agenda

- Updates
  - Learned more about DIM crypto (signal)
  - Finished legal section, sent to Prof. Walsh
  - Dug into "Decrypting the Encryption Debate: A Framework for Decision Makers"
    - Again, a very similar paper
    - I will lean on it for listing alternatives and their framework questions
    - What is my differentiation?
      - Strategy based on viewing this as a wicked problem
      - DFDs
      - Together, may illuminate some answers to questions
- Discuss
  - IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society
    - By the Society on Social Implications of Technology
    - [Website](https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2020/)
    - [Call for Papers](https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2020/authors/)
  - New abstract
  - New title
- Action items
  - Short paper on diagramming method of cryptography?
  - 2.5 Argument maps: add explanation of what people are looking at. A key: green arrows are support, red means undercut,
      yellow outline means X
  - 2.6 DFDs: explain **my contribution**, the crypto graphical syntax. And explain actors.
