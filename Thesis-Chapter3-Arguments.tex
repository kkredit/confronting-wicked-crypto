\section{Wicked Problems}

Wicked problems 

\subsection{Encryption and Exceptional Access as a Wicked Problem}

- rozenshtein_wicked_2018 convincingly argues the point at length

\subsection{Approaches to Solving Wicked Problems}

\subsubsection{Failure of the Classical Analytic Method}

\subsubsection{Muddling Through}

% Mention hermeneutics and complex adaptive systems?

\subsubsection{Pitfalls to Avoid}

- Easy answers
  - EA mandates, complexity denial
- Fallacies!
- Bad results with long technical tails

% Note: a problem with muddling through wicked problems is that each attempted fix leads to long lasting unintended side
% effects. This is especially true with matters of encryption, where the data could be stored for years till it can be
% decrypted! So must be very careful to avoid solution attempts that leave long scars.

\subsection{Plan for this Chapter}

% - But we're _exactly_ following the classical analytic method! Well, yes, but in a cooperative manner, knowing it will
%     require iteration, and being careful about side effects. It's an agile approach to policy making, but it's still
%     policy making.
% Already covered defining the problem. Next will discuss goals and list alternatives. That will feed into threat
% modeling.

\section{Desireable Outcomes}

\section{Proposed Alternatives}


commission_tackling_2018:
- Strategies
  - Authoritative
  - Competitive
  - Collaborative
- Approaches
  - Linear problem solving
    - Ineffective! Several reasons, good breakdown. Dovetails with rozenshtein_wicked_2018.
  - Holistic problem solving: adaptive, innovative, flexible, cross-organizational
- Avoid
  - Narrow solutions

rozenshtein_wicked_2018:
- Approaches
  - Muddling through (he cites Charles E. Lindblom, just like feeley_judicial_2000!)
  - Risk management (--finally, something familiar to security experts!)
    - So, a broader view of security, inclusive of both public safety and information security
    - In this model, threat actors now include terrorists, CSAM distributors, organized crime
      - Add a new character? Evil Alice and evil Bob (Alex and Becca?)? This automatically raises to question of how to
          identify bad actors--AI (lee_detecting_2020)? PhotoDNA (microsoft_2020)? Government orders (warrants)? Could
          be useful.
    - I have already suggested adding government mandates to the traditional IS threat model
  - Imperfect solutions, like lawful hacking
  - Meanwhile, invest in knowledge production and improved relationships (like "cross-organizational" from
      commission_tackling_2018)
- Avoid
  - Easy answers ("narrow solutions" from commission_tackling_2018)
    - Such as EA mandates or "golden age of surveillance"-based denials

matyas_incommensurability_2018:
- Approaches to reducing incommensurability
  - Reduce gray area between rules and principles (i.e. keep laws up to date with technology)
  - Use transparency and accountability (through technical means)

feeley_judicial_2000:
- Classical analytic method ("linear" in commission_tackling_2018)
- Incremental intuitive decision making ("Muddling through" in rozenshtein_wicked_2018)
- The hermeneutic circle

% How to tackle wicked problems in general? Take some tips from commission_tackling_2018, rozenshtein_wicked_2018,
% feeley_judicial_2000, and matyas_incommensurability_2018:
% Correctly state the problem--identify the root causes. They aren't going away, there by definition is no clear long
% term solution. Put the proposed solutions in context--none are perfect, none are permanent. For EA in particular,
% consider balance of principles and rules.

% Subject one: do we even want EA?
%  --> no? exit here
%  --> yes? carry on
%  --> pragmatist? carry on
% include fallacies argument map here

% ... group_2019, ruiz_there_2018, rozenshtein_2019

% Subject two: what properties would good EA have?
% easy for LEAs to use? hard? expensive? voluntary? unable to be used for mass surveillance? transparent (attempts are
%   visible)? alignment of values with security (e.g. discourages bug hoarding)? adaptable (since solution won't be
%   permanent, either technically or according to collective will as things change rozenshtein_wicked_2018)? suited to
%   rules and principles (matyas_incommensurability_2018)?

% Subject three: what options do we have?
% map of properties onto proposals--leads into threat modeling, which will check the veracity of claims

% In this chapter, develop the arguments employed in EA debates. Make use of argument maps to break down and visualize the
% debate, as shown in \myfig{fig-args-top-level}.

%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{arguments/build/top-level.pdf}
%     \caption[Argument: Top Level]{Top level arguments for and against exceptional access.}
%     \label{fig-args-top-level}
% \end{figure}

% The debate over exceptional access takes place on two fundamental levels:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Whether cryptosystems with exceptional access represent a net benefit to society
%     \item Whether and how to conduct exceptional access research
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Arguments For}

% Why EA is a benefit to society:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Absolute privacy is not a right
%     \item Encryption gives too much power to the individual
%     \item EA would allow more crimes to be prevented and prosecuted
% \end{itemize}

% Why to research EA:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item EA done well would be more secure and privacy preserving than EA done poorly
%     \item The threat of legislative action creates urgency
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Arguments Against}

% Why EA is a danger to society:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Privacy is an absolute right
%     \item Exceptional access gives too much power to the state
%     \item Exceptional access is not possible in an acceptably secure manner
% \end{itemize}

% Why not to research EA:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item With both security and privacy in a poor state, research should be focused on strengthening, not weakening,
%             them
%     \item The technical community should not entertain delusions about what is truly possible
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Fallacious Arguments}

% Fallacy definitions come from the helpful University of North Carolina Writing Center \cite{unc_2020}. Also cited:
% \cite{hanna_2019}.

% Fallacies are as shown in \myfig{fig-args-fallacies}.
