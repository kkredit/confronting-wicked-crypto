% Already covered defining the problem. Next will discuss goals and list alternatives. That will feed into threat
% modeling

\section{Mapping the EA Debate}

\subsection{Desireable Outcomes}

% See committee_decrypting_2018!
% For a wholistic threat model, include both the threats of government (legislation) and of criminal abusers of your
% system.

\subsection{Proposed Alternatives}

% See committee_decrypting_2018!

% Subject one: do we even want EA?
%  --> no? exit here
%  --> yes? carry on
%  --> pragmatist? carry on
% include fallacies argument map here
% see rozenshtein_wicked_2018, benaloh_what_2018, soesanto_2018, ministerial_2018, fbi_2020, brantley_2018, lund_2020
% ... group_2019, ruiz_there_2018, rozenshtein_2019

% Subject two: what properties would good EA have?
% easy for LEAs to use? hard? expensive? voluntary? unable to be used for mass surveillance? transparent (attempts are
%   visible)? alignment of values with security (e.g. discourages bug hoarding)? adaptable (since solution won't be
%   permanent, either technically or according to collective will as things change rozenshtein_wicked_2018)? suited to
%   rules and principles (matyas_incommensurability_2018)?

% Subject three: what options do we have?
% map of properties onto proposals--leads into threat modeling, which will check the veracity of claims

% In this chapter, develop the arguments employed in EA debates. Make use of argument maps to break down and visualize the
% debate, as shown in \myfig{fig-args-top-level}.

%     \caption[Argument: Top Level]{Top level arguments for and against exceptional access.}
%     \label{fig-args-top-level}
% \end{figure}

% The debate over exceptional access takes place on two fundamental levels:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Whether cryptosystems with exceptional access represent a net benefit to society
%     \item Whether and how to conduct exceptional access research
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Arguments For}

% Why EA is a benefit to society:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Absolute privacy is not a right
%     \item Encryption gives too much power to the individual
%     \item EA would allow more crimes to be prevented and prosecuted
% \end{itemize}

% Why to research EA:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item EA done well would be more secure and privacy preserving than EA done poorly
%     \item The threat of legislative action creates urgency
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Arguments Against}

% Why EA is a danger to society:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Privacy is an absolute right
%     \item Exceptional access gives too much power to the state
%     \item Exceptional access is not possible in an acceptably secure manner
% \end{itemize}

% Why not to research EA:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item With both security and privacy in a poor state, research should be focused on strengthening, not weakening,
%             them
%     \item The technical community should not entertain delusions about what is truly possible
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Fallacious Arguments}

% Fallacy definitions come from the helpful University of North Carolina Writing Center \cite{unc_2020}. Also cited:
% \cite{hanna_2019}.

% Fallacies are as shown in \myfig{fig-args-fallacies}.
